Chapter 1

It was a clear day in the Arid Plains, which was an unusual sight for this time of year. Azak drew in a deep breath. The air was cool and refreshing as he looked at the small band of men he led. There were ten of them in all. Nine were from the Azak’s tribe, the Eltiyah. One was a foreigner of the Church of the One God.
Azak brushed back his long black hair as a breeze blew flinging the locks in his face. He was taller than most men in his tribe. His skin was a dark tan while being the only one in the tribe with green eyes. The elders said at the time of his birth that his eyes indicated that the world was ready to begin healing itself from the Great Cataclysm.
“How do you like the hunt?” Azak asked with a toothy smile.
The priest looked at him as if Azak had interrupted some deep and philosophical thought he was pondering. He immediately recovered and said, “Why I find it quite fascinating actually.”
The priest’s name was Nao. He was a pale skinned fellow who looked to have went many nights without food considering his very lean physique. He wore a white robe and a pendant indicating him as a servant of the One God which was the symbol of Infinity.
Azak pointed to the sand buffalo’s corpse which was the prize of the hunting party. It was a lumbering beast that lay on a cart which had to be pulled by four horses due to its massive bulk.
“That beast could feed the tribe for a week.” Azak informed him. “Though honestly the leather it holds makes it more valuable to us. We will use that for trade when we come across any other nomads.
“Yes, I find that most interesting indeed,” the priest said stroking his brown beard. “There are far more nomadic tribes in this region than from what I am certainly used to. Back south you are more likely to run into war bands or worse.”
“Good thing the Great Expanse protects us from the barbarians of the south,” Azak said again with a grin. “Though to be honest the further north we go the more danger the caravan is likely to be in. It is said that the Necrofiends inhabit the Bleaklands and prey on any travelers that encroach upon their territory.”
“Rubbish,” the priest said. “I have never seen any proof of Necrofiends in all my years of travel. It is more than likely wild mages who have conjured up stories to scare away anyone who might threaten their solitary existence.”
Azak patted the priest on the back. A bit harder than the priest seemed to care for. “You are probably right, priest of the One God! Now! We are almost home!”

The hunting party was met with cheers and celebration from the caravan. Children ran to point and discuss the size of the sand buffalo. Women ran to greet their husbands and lovers.
Azak patted the priest on the back. This time more gently. “Duties call, my brother. Eat! Drink! We will see each other soon!”
He made his way to his tent which was bigger than most of the other hunter’s. Since he was Forerunner of the hunting party, he was granted the biggest canvas as a show of strength and respect.
Slowly he pulled back the hide which served as the door to his home. He quietly entered and saw Isante, his wife laying on the bed. She had his back to him as he walked over to her. He put his finger on a lock of her hair and pulled it behind her ear.
“You call yourself a stalker?” Isante asked. “I heard you coming from a mile away.”
He laughed and lay beside her. He put his arm around her and rested his hand on her belly.
“How is the little one holding up?” he whispered.
“She is kicking now,” she informed him.
“She?” he asked.
“Oh, yes, I found out that he is a she,” she told him matter of fact.
He sat upright and leaned over as he laughed. “Oh, how did you find this out?”
“A mother knows these things,” she informed him. “She will have my looks. Slender and short. Her hair will be streaked with blonde on top of black.”
“Just like you, aye?” he asked with a smile.
“Indeed. She will have your eyes though. Oh, yes. Definitely your eyes.”
He lay back down and looked up trying to picture the image. He was filled with joy and excitement and let out a sigh. “What will we call her?”
“Mira.”
Azak smiled and looked into her eyes then leaned forward and kissed her.
“I love you,” he said softly.
“And I you...” she said. “Are they expecting you?”
“Not for a while.”
“Time enough for you to show me your love?”
“There is always time enough for that,” he said with a smile.

That night the caravan built a great bonfire in celebration of a successful hunt. They all drank wine and ate meat. They danced around the fire and sang songs in their old tongue.
Azak was dancing and saw the priest looking at the spectacle in fascination. He stopped in mid dance and approached the holy man.
“Priests do not dance?” Azak asked him.
“Some priests do I am sure but not this one,” Nao informed him.
Isante came walking over. “Are you trying to convert my husband again,” she asked playfully.
“Oh, you know Azak’s heart is a rock when it comes to spiritual matters,” the priest said with a laugh.
Azak smiled. “I tend to concentrate on more practical matters. Besides you already have converted my wife. That should be trophy enough for your travels, aye?”
“Stop teasing him,” Isante said grabbing his arm. She looked at the priest. “Do you know that Azak’s mother was also a believer of the One God?”
“Really?” he said curiously. “How is that possible?”
“Well...” she began, “His mother was a white woman whose parents were missionaries. They had only recently reached the Arid Plains when they were attacked by raiders. His mother was quite young when this happen. Six years old if I recall. The Etiyah found her with her dead mother who clung to a Holy Book. She was raised by the caravan and kept her faith.”
“She did not pass it on to you, Azak?” the priest asked.
“She tried,” Azak admitted. “While my father tried to teach me the ways of the Great Spirit. He would always argue they were pretty much the same thing. Either way, I never really took much interest.”
“He was always the skeptic,” Isante insisted.
“Well,” Azak said, “Neither the One God or Great Spirit saved of my parents from the plague that killed a third of our caravan when I was a boy. I was spared. That should tell you something.”
They stood there for a time in silence listening to the music until finally Isante left for the tent. The priest and Azak continued to listen while staring at the flames of the bonfire.
“I am curious as to the song being sung.”
Azak’s chin tilted upwards in pride. “That is the song of our tribe. The Last March of Etiyah.”
“Would you mind singing me the chorus?” Nao asked curiously.
Azak nodded and wait for the chorus to fall in line as he sang along. “Nohdar homun exleetay mortoo. Enwixley tel morta fomun harto tu nolay tul o Etiyah.”
“What does it mean?”
“The caravan shall march on. Until the end of time, led by the last of the Etiyah.”
The bonfire raged on and the caravan sang and danced through the night.

The next day, Azak and the hunting party went on a scouting charge. Their goal was to study the sand buffaloes in order to gauge which direction the herd would be moving. With that information, the elders of the caravan would decide whether to follow the herd or not.
They watched until mid afternoon when they were sure that the herd was heading east. Then Azak gave the signal that they should return to the caravan. The sun was beginning to set when one of the scouts noticed smoke coming the caravan’s direction.
Azak ran to the top of the hill and confirmed that the fire was too close to the caravan to be coincidence. He thought maybe they would have set a bonfire but that would have defied tradition. It had to be something else. He gave the order to run.

They came upon the caravan in ashes and ruin. Bodies were strewn about the camp . Azak ran to his personal tent and stopped when he reached the door. He paused for a moment and then gathered his strength opening it.
His heart sank into the bottom of his stomach. Isante lay on the floor in a bloody heap. Her eyes gazed upwards looking at nothing. She had two stab wounds. One in the chest and one in her stomach.
Tears fell from Azak’s face. He wailed. He dropped to his knees over Isante’s lifeless body. He buried his face in her bosom hoping to hear a heartbeat. There was nothing to be heard except the sounds of his own screams.

Many minutes passed before Azak finally stood up. He carried Isante’s body with him. The hunters had gathered outside. Whatever they were talking about they ceased in conversation as they saw Azak carrying his wife and unborn child.
They helped him bury her as well as the rest of their loved ones. The caravan was well over a hundred people and there were not enough hunters to bury them all. Not if they were to catch up with who did this.
“Azak!” one of the hunters exclaimed. Azak ran over to look down upon Father Nao. The priest looked up though his eyes had been gouged out. He held a wound at his side that was bleeding slowly. Azak bent over to cradle the man’s head.
“Azak?” Nao asked. “Is that you?”
“It’s me,” Azak said, almost a whisper.
“I tried to fight... I tried to stop them...”
“Who did this?” Azak asked.
“I know them,” the priest said with a trembling voice. “I know of them... They were Disciples of Deus. I could tell by their markings... They are a twisted faith bent on holocaust. That is their way.”
“How many?” Azak dared to ask.
“Too many...” Nao said solemnly. “I ask you, good friend. I am at the end and the pain is more than I can bare. Will you finish it?
A tear ran down Azak’s cheek. “Just rest,” he said. He quickly slid his hunting knife in between the priest’s ribs piercing his heart. He was dead in an instant.

After five hours of sprinting Azak and his hunting party finally caught up with the marauders who they were sure by the tracks had slaughtered the caravan. They all looked to Azak for instruction.
“Slings first,” Azak told them. “Throw two stones. Run while throwing another. Then we use spears.”
They all nodded solemnly. There looked to be over a hundred of the war band and only nine of them. Each knew that there would be no escape.
Since it was dark there was no point in waiting. They crept within sling throw distance and let loose their first volley. Nine stones were thrown and nine stones hit their marks. It was impossible to tell if each did fatal damage at this range. They let loose their second volley and made their charge.
Horns blew within the marauder camp. Azak charged forward as he twirled his sling letting loose another stone. He hit the horn blower square between the eyes killing him instantly.
Azak dropped the sling and pulled up his spear. The nine nomadic warriors clashed into the camp of marauders stabbing and slashing, killing and maiming as they went.
As Azak stabbed his second marauder he noticed that they all were bald with a tattoo of a vertical red eye on their forehead. He pulled his spear free and spun around slashing another man’s throat open.
“Nohdar homun exleetay mortoo,” Azak began to sing loudly as he continued his slaughter. It was heard by his comrades and the chorus was sung loudly. “Enwixley tel morta fomun harto tu nolay tul o Etiyah.”
There were shouts coming from all throughout the camp. Azak guessed they had downed maybe twenty. That still left many more to contend with and they were without the element of surprise now. He pressed on as he thought about his wife and daughter. He stabbed a man in the gut and watched as he struggled to hold his entrails in.
Quickly he turned to face two more of the bald warriors. He spun about with his spear extended. One man was cut across the chest while the other blocked the attack with his sword. Azak came in a quick succession stabbing the man once in the leg and again in the side.
“Nohdar homun exleetay mortoo,” he sang loudly as if his life depended on it. “Enwixley tel morta fomun harto tu nolay tul o Etiyah.”
It was at this time he noticed that his hunting party was now being overrun. He watched as two of his comrades were killed by five men. He rushed over to offer assistance knowing he was too late. Another of his party saw him and joined in. Together they fell the five men though Azak took a wound to the arm.
Then his comrade fell and he noticed that he was the sole survivor. He yelled at the top of his lungs as he was surrounded by ten men.
They encircled him and tried to overwhelm him by attacking at once. Azak spun and stabbed deliberately and a quick motion that fell two of the attackers. He leaped onto another man after stabbing him in the foot. As he came down he pulled a knife from his boot and stuck him in the back.
They rushed him again and again he parried and dodged and counterattacked. Three fell this time from Azak’s wild barrage of spear strikes. Azak felt a pain in his side and looked down to see he had been stabbed.
“Enough!” a voice said. The bald attackers stopped their assault and stepped to the side to reveal an armored man with long blue hair and a silver suit of armor. He brandished a long two handed sword that was elaborately designed. Despite its bulk, it appeared light as the man wielded it.
The man had very long ears pointed outward indicating he was of the elfen race. His pale skin complimented his eyes which were solid white save for his blue pupils.
“You killed my family!” Azak screamed.
The man seemed to ignore Azak’s declaration. Instead he came in fast with his sword. Azak put up his spear to block. Despite the effort the flat part of the blade hit the spear and then crushed into Azak’s chest sending him sprawling backwards.
Azak quickly leaped up. He rotated his spear and took a defensive posture bending at the knees and arching his back. He sidestepped quickly as the man came on the offensive again.
This time Azak was ready. He backed up as the man swung the broadsword and the blade barely missed his stomach. Azak retaliated by poking once with his spear only to have it bounce harmlessly off the man’s breastplate.
The man continued his attack by bringing his blade in a downward chop which Azak managed to dodge by rolling to the side. Again Azak tried to counter, this time stabbing at one of the slits of armor but to no avail. The armor was without a weak spot.
“I’ll kill you you bastard!” Azak proclaimed.
The man came forward again and spun around quickly with his sword extended. It was faster than Azak had ever seen anyone move. He managed to block the first attack but the second attack cut his spear in two. The third attack left him with a gash in his belly.
Azak fell to his knees as he struggled to keep himself from being completely disemboweled by the wound . He cradled the cut instinctively. He looked up only to see the man towering before him.
“You killed them all! Why!?” Azak screamed at him with tears in his eyes.
“The Old God is dead,” the man said. Azak almost mistook his tone as pity. “If Lord Deus is to be free we must give blood sacrifice.”
Azak did not respond. He just waited for death. He had no more strength to fight back. He would not give this person the satisfaction any longer.
Azak was lifted into the air by the broadsword as the man stabbed upwards piercing his heart. He died instantly.

Azak felt the world flee him. Or maybe it was he who fled the world. The only thing he knew for sure that everything he knew was becoming a distant memory. He crashed into water.
He was caught up in a current too powerful to fight against. Though he flailed and tried to gain his composure he was totally helpless. The blood red water was taking him to wherever it wished. He thought he should have drowned because he could not breath. He felt suffocation. Death did not happen though. Only pain and helplessness.

Azak continued on this path for hours. He prayed to every god he knew to end this torture. He would have rather wished to never existed at all than to face this torrent. Death or oblivion did not come. Instead he found himself at a waterfall.
He fell for hours more still. The drop was a relief for in it was no pain or suffocation. Just the emptiness and the sprays of water caught in the gravity of whatever this was.

Azak splashed down into the water. This time the river was more forceful and the water was boiling hot. He could feel it rupture his skin. He was swept away more quickly than before and rushed onward to where the river flow took him. After what seemed like many hours or perhaps days for his grasp on time felt like some foreign memory to him, Azak finally washed upon a rocky beach.
He stood up and screamed as he felt his skin burn from the acidic air. He was not sure how he even had skin left but the pain was too intense to contemplate. He wailed as he looked at his hands expecting them to have the flesh burnt off to the bone in an instant. The burning continued and his skin and muscles seemed to regenerate itself to keep the torture ongoing. As he cried out, he heard a booming voice that sounded like a thousand lightning bolts had crashed in front of him.
He looked forward to see a colossal creature rise from the ground in front of him. The head was massive as it appeared to dig itself out. It had massive fangs that numbered into the hundreds as well as many eyes that reminded him of some insect he had once known in what felt like now to be some other life. As it continued its upward ascent, the segmented body was pushed by massive arms with vicious talons. At its height, it stood taller than any mountain Azak had ever seen.
The creature’s head tilted down towards Azak. A booming voice filled his head as the creature spoke.
“I am Xaixuhm,” the voice bellowed. “To you mortal, I am god. You belong to me. Consider yourself blessed that I have taken notice of a pitiful creature such as yourself.”
Azak could only look on in pain and despair barely able to comprehend anything of what he was witnessing.
The creature began to shrink at this moment. Its massive frame retreating within itself until it was no bigger than a man. It then took the shape of a man that had dark skin with a black robe and blood red eyes. He approached Azak and a large bubble surrounded the two.
Azak gasped for air as he realized the acidic atmosphere had retreated inside the bubble. The pain he felt became less overwhelming. He rejoiced inwardly at the moment of respite he had so craved for what now felt like an eternity.
“You have been granted a second chance at life,” the man said. His voice sounding soft compared to the creature it once was though just as menacing. “You will now do my bidding. This will come as a relief because what I want is for you to find the man who sent you here to begin with.”
Azak looked at the man. He vaguely recollected the battle he participated in. He visualized the man’s face that had killed him. He thought of his wife and unborn child and wept.
“This man is a part of a greater plan.” the dark skin manned explained. “More will be revealed to you in time. For now relish in the new life I bestow upon you.”
He laid hands upon the weeping Azak. It was then Azak felt himself thrust back into the river. Faster than a bold of lightning he traveled upstream. He shot up the waterfall. There was no pain. He could only look down in wonder.
Azak gasped as he felt the air enter his lungs. He remembered what it was like to be alive. Though what he felt now was… different. He knew he was back among the living as he could see the starry night sky. Vengeance, it would seem, was still within his grasp.





























Chapter 2

It was cold in the long dark hallway as Zoe Renvar made her way down the windowless corridor. She carried a compact briefcase. Along the walls there were paintings and statues of great men who did great deeds of some great event that Zoe had heard a hundred times before.
The same old story, she thought. While she appreciated history as much as the next person, Zoe held a disdain for men who felt the need to build statues of themselves to measure their greatness.
It felt to her as if the lifeless eyes of both statue and painting alike watched her every step, judging her all the while. She knew that the entire system which these men represented all rested on the sole discretion of how she conducts her business this day.
New Verum was the city in which she lived. It was an ancient city whose original inhabitants had long since vanquished by the Cataclysm which broke the world. Two hundred years ago, her ancestors had wandered the Wastelands looking for a home found this city of Verum. It was complete ruins but after the founding of the city, people from all over the Wastelands flocked to join and rebuild it. Now in only two hundred years the once ruined megapolis stood defiant over the Wastelands with towering skyscrapers and neon colored lights that could be seen for a thousand miles. Where there was once death and decay now there was a thriving society.
Massive megastructures were built among the ruins of the Old City. The great rebuilding took place and for the next two hundred years the people repaired and rediscovered the technology of old. A Federal Republic was formed to which the aristocrats would choose how to manage the affairs of the people.
Zoe herself had dedicated herself to protecting this way of life. That is why she became a Federal Intelligence Agent. Her hopes and dreams since she was a young girl was being able to make a difference to New Verum that would guarantee the legacy of this shining city would never die.
She became older and thus more practical. Her dream never died though her eyes opened up to the corruption which was ingrained into the lifeblood of the social order.
Zoe had a fair skinned complexion with a slim build though her figure was curved from top to bottom. Both her hair and eyes were a sanguine red. These were accentuated with the red eye shadow she wore complimented by the lipstick that made her lips look all the more radiant.
She moved with a grace and precision of one who had years of training in the combat arts. She was said to have the alacrity and composure of a feline that was stalking its prey.
Her .45 automatic pistol that hung at her side only confirmed that she was of a different breed. It had a long barrel that sported an array of different modes. It was custom made just for her specific style. She wore the uniform of a Federal Intelligence Agent. A black body suit that clung to the skin tightly so that every move seemed deliberate. A hood and mask lay at her shoulder blades because when the situation called for it she could activate the refractive camouflage that would make her all but invisible. ​Her tool belt seemed to be a bulky thing on her slender hips for it carried an array of different clips for pistol. Aside from that the most important piece of the belt was the buckle which housed a regenerative Fusion Shield. When activated, if anything with enough force were to hit her that would warrant any significant damage to her body the shield would absorb the impact. Though it made her invulnerable for a time the shield would be depleted after enough stress in which it would take a few minutes to recharge.
The final most noticeable accessory on her person was the strange crown which she wore on her brow. It was slender and metallic with a silvery tint. This was her Neural Interface Crown. With it she could activate her custom built artificial intelligence that could feed her virtually any information that was stored in the Network. Not only that but if she so desired she could perform a deep dive into the Net with only a thought. If she finds herself in a combat situation then her virtual targeting goggles will appear from it that also has an array of uses.
Her eyes narrowed as she approached the end of the hallway to the massive double doors that stood before her. On each door were intricate carvings of various designs and symbols. At the center of this artistry was a face that looked plump and indifferent.
“Zoe Renvar,” she said and there was a brief pause and the stone faces’ eyes lit up a green hue. Then the doors slowly swung open. The bulk of the frames eerily silent as they allowed for entry.
She stepped into the chamber to see the Parliamentary Board sitting and talking around the large round table which was known as the Forum. She instinctively took in her surroundings. With no windows and no other portals to speak of it was obvious that the doors in which she had come in was the only means of escape. The walls were stone brick and mortar with no real beauty but rather a drab undertone that made Zoe’s skin crawl. She hated enclosed spaces and even more she hated lack of decor even when business dictated one’s undivided attention.
Two giant statues at the far side of the room were the only ornamentation. The statues were two angelic figures of opposite sex reaching for the sky and holding up a key in which both gripped on either side. Their faces revealed individuals who seemed to be both tortured and joyous as they performed the task of raising the monument which they gripped tightly while holding up proudly.
“This is unacceptable!” she heard one man say. She knew him as Baron Melchor who oversees the 6th District. An older man who seemed far too frail for his size. “If we do not quell these terrorist attacks once and for all we will have a full uprising on our hands!” he continued as he pounded his fist on the table.
“Well it is clear that the 6th district would be most upset over this seeing as how they have not been effected by an attack in the slightest!” Baron Sharp interjected. Zoe found him to be freakishly tall and lanky. She recalled once talking to him up close for a brief time and having a sore neck for the rest of the evening. “We in the 4th District have had three attacks in the past six months!”
“Gentlemen, please. I ask that you be patient and speak one at a time.” Zoe instantly recognized the man to be Prime Director Degausse Baxter. He was a man who Zoe remembered to have blond hair only 3 years prior. His hair was now completely gray. Stress of being the Prime Director, Zoe thought.
“We have convened this meeting to discuss specifically the terrorists attacks,” Director Baxter continued. “ That is why General Renvar is here today as our adviser. I feel as strongly as you do that we need to get to the bottom of this and General Renvar has been in charge of the investigation since the attacks started a year ago.” He motioned to the man sitting to his right.
The man sitting to his right was General Martok Renvar. His hair was short cropped and gray and he wore a well groomed short beard. His facial features were hard and broad by the seriousness which the air around him commanded. He was not a very tall man but the demeanor at which he carried himself demanded respect and attention. His eyes were blazing red and piercing as they scanned the surrounding men at the table. Zoe knew his gaze all too well seeing as how the general was also her father.
“One year and six days ago a man blew himself up at the Grand Market.” General Renvar began, his voice echoing through the chamber. “He killed sixty one civilians while injuring over two hundred more using a micro fusion grenade. There was no body to recover and the only way we were able to get a description of the man was by watching the security footage. The odd thing about this man is that somehow he had been erased from the Network. Meaning there is no evidence of him having ever existed in the system. For all intensive purposes he is a ghost. Since then there have been eighteen similar attacks within our city. Each time has always revealed the same trace-less ghosts to which we have had no way to identify.”
“That is until today. I present to you my daughter. Zoe Renvar of the Federal Intelligence Agency.” He motioned to Zoe and she approached the table as her father sat down.
Zoe sat the miniature briefcase on the table and then put her hands behind her. She straightened up and put her chin high which gave the impression that she had grew an inch. “I will be as brief as I can. Last night, I led a raid on a compound in the Waterfront District. We had been given a lead of a nuclear fusion device being smuggled in by one of our under covers working for the Independent Argosy League. According to our reports the IAL have been pirating contraband into the city for quite some time now. It was only dumb luck that our agent caught wind of the payload that was being brought in this time.
“After raiding the warehouse where the drop was made we found the workings of a very large organization. This organization calls itself the Legion. We know this because of the intel we gathered from the computers and documents in the building. We were unable to extract any members because once we breached the building they all killed themselves. The way they were able to accomplish this was revealed after doing a thorough autopsy on one of the victims.”
She opened the briefcase and from it pulled a computer chip that was the size of her index finger. She hovered it in front of her for a moment then continued with her debriefing. “This chip is some kind of new Neural Processor that is surgically installed into the user’s brain.” As anticipated murmurs erupted around the table. She waited for them to die down.
“ With this chip we have theorized that the user has a constant virtual connection to the Neural Net round-the-clock. The uses of such a device are still being analyzed but already the benefits seem to be extensive. From downloading information with the slightest of effort or being able to communicate telepathically, the possibilities all seem to be a leap in what our Science Division has been capable of up to this point. The Legion it seems is well funded with some very powerful allies.” She paused to let the room digest this bit of heavy information.
“What information we have been able to piece together is that the Legion is spread throughout the city.” she continued. “It is unknown what their motives are for the attacks but it is clear that they are willing to go through with many more and they show no remorse or fear of reprisal. We also know that they have begun a propaganda campaign on the Neural Net with the objective of increasing their ranks while simultaneously creating dissent against the government.”
Zoe nodded to her father and he looked around the room. Each of the Baron’s held different expressions but Zoe could feel the eagerness they had in anticipating what he would say.
“The Federal Intelligence Agency is a branch of the military. However, the jurisdiction in which they can conduct their searches on private citizens is limited especially towards First Class Citizens. In order to avoid martial law I implore this Parliament to allow for the removal of these restrictions for the FIA. In doing so I am certain that our investigation can come to a faster and more precise close as we bring the Legion to justice and restore peace and order to New Verum.” Again murmurs erupted nervously around the room.
One man stood with a hand raised and the rest of the Barons went silent. The man was Baron Vlad. A very respected politician and a cunning debater from what Zoe had heard. The other Barons looked to him for leadership and he had the ear of the Prime Director. His smooth voice echoed through the chamber.
“I stand to put the motion forth to allow the military whatever means they see fit in regards to hunting down these terrorists. We shall allow them full jurisdiction over the entirety of New Verum until the threat of the Legion has been completely eradicated. Be this citizen or corporation we shall leave no stone unturned!”
The table erupted in shouts of “Hear! Hear!” while the Barons banged one hand on the table.
It was done, Zoe thought. Just like her father had predicted. Though she was relieved there was also a part of her that was perturbed. She pushed the feeling aside as her father’s eyes met hers. She nodded in approval as the Barons all stood up clapping with chants of “Long live New Verum!”.

The trip to the apartment was uneventful, Zoe thought as she zoomed past traffic on her high performance sport motorcycle. What would have taken her two hours in a car Zoe managed to do in twenty minutes. She pulled into the parking garage and before she knew it had made her way up to the floor she lived on.
As she entered her apartment she inhaled the aroma of herbs and spices from someone cooking.
“Greetings Zozo!” she heard her android companion say from the kitchen. His sweet voice was appealing and modulated.
“Hey Kit,” Zoe chimed as she bent over sideways to unlace her boots. “What are you cooking in there? It smells wonderful.”
“Oh, well this dish is known as Rosemary’s Lamb. It is a stew that has... Well... Lamb! I’ve also added various seasonings that I know for a fact you will enjoy!”
Zoe kicked off her boots as she entered her room. She would have put them up but Kit would have complained that she was stealing his glory. She unzipped her uniform and pulled it off. It felt relieving as the cool air from the apartment touched her bare skin. Kit had already put out her clothes on the bed. A pair of panties and a crop top.
Far too luxurious to live in such freedom, she mused to herself as she put her clothes on. She pulled the pin out of her bun that held her hair so tight on her scalp and shook her neck from side to side. Her hair dropped down her back to reveal layers of dazzling red hair.
After washing her face off from all the make up and grime she brushed her teeth. She looked into the mirror and saw a young woman staring back at her.
“Careful tiger,” she told herself and walked out the bathroom. The light automatically cutting off as she exited.
She made her way into the living room and draped herself over the armchair in the center of the room. There was a sleek glass in front of her with a generous helping of red wine. She sat herself upright and grabbed the glass and took a big gulp. She felt the bitter sweet drink as it went into her mouth and down her throat thinking that it had found its way to tickle her at the soul.
“News,” she said matter of fact and the image of the New Verum Broadcasting Station appeared in front of her. She saw two reporters in front of her and from the perspective she was in they had depth and seemed as though she could reach out and touch them. Zoe knew though that the image was flat and the three dimensional appearance was only an illusion of light. Had she the energy to stand up and walk to the side of it she would barely see a flat beam of light being projected by the minuscule camera embedded within the table.
“Student protesters continue to clash with New Verum military police for the fifth week straight over tax reform and voting rights,” the reporter on the left said. A small woman who Zoe thought looked like a porcelain doll that would break if she were to drop. Pretty, Zoe thought, but fake.
Kit appeared in the room with a bowl of stew. He handed it to Zoe gently and placed her spoon and napkin carefully on the table. “Be careful with that because it’s still hot,” he warned her.
“Thanks for the concern,” she goaded him. Though his face could not change she could feel the annoyance come off of him.
Kit was a good head taller than Zoe standing almost a full two meters. He appeared to be human on the outside. His entire look was custom tailored by Zoe. He has dark tan skin and long brown hair. His eyes were a sparkly blue and besides his head there was not a hair to be found on him. He was not too muscular but extremely lean and cut. Though Zoe did not fancy men, she loved all things beautiful and she was happy in the work she had done with designing Kit’s aesthetics.
“I know how you are Zozo,” Kit chided her. “As soon as I turn my head you will try and swallow the entirety of that bowl’s contents. Well I hope you don’t expect me to shuttle you to the hospital for second degree burns!”
Zoe also designed Kit’s personality. Extremely loyal and overly protective. She also made sure to put a bit of femininity in his speech. To most people it came off as comical but to Zoe she thought of him less of a machine and more of a sibling.
“Relax, mother,” she said with a smile. Not only had her mother given her the nickname of Zozo, she always remained adamant that Zoe conduct herself as a proper lady would.
Kit turned towards the projection and tilted his head to the side slightly as he caught wind of what was being talked about.
“The technorapper known as Kaypac was attacked earlier today by a berserk fan,” the other reporter said. A dark skinned man who wore a clean cut mustache and had a leaden voice. “He has tested positive for the drug Blue Flow. A stimulant on the street with a mixture of adrenaline and highly addictive physiological chemicals.”
“What is the world coming to?” Kit complained. “Drugs and violence every time you turn on the news. Well if it were possible I would say we pack up and leave this city.”
Zoe rolled her eyes. “We can always live in the Wastelands. You might rust but I think I would be okay.”
“This is serious,” Kit said. “Zozo, I worry about you. With your profession it is only a matter of time before something happens.”
She ignored the statement. “Projector off,” she said. She began to eat her soup and Kit went back to the kitchen. She could hear him cleaning as she ate the delicious stew. After she had finished she sat the bowl on the table and reached up to grab her neural crown.
Still work to be done, she thought bleakly. “Kit, I’m diving. Don’t interrupt me.” She knew he wouldn’t. It felt good to give the order however.
“Dive,” she commanded. The crown formed a green light that dropped down in front of her eyes. As she gazed into the light the world around her became distant as if she had been picked up and carried far away suddenly and swiftly. The numbers and streaks of light around immersed her entirety until she was completely enveloped in the Network.
Instead of being in her clothes she wore at the apartment she now donned a sparkling white cat suit.
“Iree, come online,” Zoe said. It prompted her custom made artificial intelligence to boot up.
“I am here, Zoe,” a computerized voice said. It was a soft womanly voice. Iree could process over 50 trillion calculations a second. This almost doubled what government or commercial A.I. could do. Not only that, Iree was specifically designed to react to certain thought patterns that Zoe had preallocated that would perform an array of command prompts. Iree was also self aware and could adapt to changing circumstances.
She checked her firewalls and anti-viruses with a quick thought. Everything was nominal and she was ready to leave the load out screen.
“Cryptic Wire,” she commanded and instantly she felt her body pulled into one of the blips of light in the distance. As she came up on the light she felt a command prompt asking for a password.
“Zoe Renvar. Override.” she said. Immediately the password wall fizzled and Zoe found herself at the door of what looked like a club in the street. This was just an image being constructed in her mind by programming. It was nothing more than ones and zeros but to the user of the Network it took the image of whatever the programmer desired.
The music was loud. That was the first thing Zoe noticed because had it been the real world her ear drums would have been bleeding. She took a moment to reconfigure the background input and the music subsided to a low hum. As she explored her surroundings she noticed the two floors of the establishment. On the bottom floor were stripper poles, a dance floor, and various tables that had an assortment of patrons doing a range of things. She noticed the bar and slowly approached it.
“What can I get you, beautiful?” the bartender asked. A young man with a good muscular build and a friendly face. He was just an avatar of the man who guided the neural crown somewhere within the city accessed to the Network just like Zoe. With your avatar you could modify your look to how you saw fit so there was no way of knowing if this image matched up to his true to form self.
“I need information,” Zoe told him. “I am looking for a regular.”
“Oh, well I am afraid that is going to cost you,” the man said with a smile. “Two hundred credits.”
Zoe inputted the command with a thought. “Done.” she told him.
He paused for a second. “Okay. Who is it that you want?”
“A man named Lithium.”
“Second floor, V.I.P. room number twelve” the man said as he washed a glass. A pointless exercise, Zoe thought. “Why you looking for a loser like him? A girl like you is better off than with a loser like him. We don’t normally get a girl of your tier here.”
“That information will cost more than you have,” she said with a smile and walked off leaving the man to clean his virtual glass.
She walked past a table of a group of people playing a game of death circle. A game where you take an empty revolver and put one bullet in the chamber. After spinning the cylinder the point of the game was to fire the gun at your head and if luck was on your side the gun would click instead of firing the one bullet. It was a silly game to play in a virtual world but Zoe imagined it must give some people a feeling of control when they are violently booted from the Network only to go through the motions of re-logging in again.
“Iree, scan for any threats,” Zoe thought which prompted Iree to do a sweep of the club. “I don’t want to get caught unawares only to be booted by some net junkie.”
“Done,” Iree ringed. “There are no immediate threats that I can detect. I am reading moderate threat levels from twenty three individuals in the vicinity…”
“Just let me know if they try anything,” Zoe instructed.
She made her way up the stairs of the club. She had to all but step over a couple who were engaging in a lewd make out session on the stair well. As she came to the second floor of the club she looked around to the various rooms. They were all open besides a privacy curtain that indicated the small venues were occupied. She found room twelve and approached.
Before entering she did a scan inside the room to indicate what exactly she was walking into. There was a young man in his early twenties with long blonde hair wearing a tropical shirt and blue jean shorts sitting on a sectional sofa. He was throwing virtual dollar bills at two females who were naked all save their thongs and stilettos. She immediately did a quick hack of the young man’s neural interface and with a quick thought she formed a .45 pistol in her hand that was similar to her standard sidearm. She threw back the curtain with the pistol pointed straight at the man.
“Get out.” she said calmly. The two girls did not look frightened but rather confused.
“What is this, Lithium? Some kind of role play thing?” one of the girls asked. A blonde girl whose bosoms seemed to be virtually enhanced because if it was her size in the real world she would have major back problems.
“I… can’t move… what the fuck!” the young man exclaimed.
“I’ve hacked your neural interface.” Zoe told him. “You won’t be going anywhere until I give up control. You won’t even be able to log out. Unless someone forces your neural crown from your head. In which case it will be very unpleasant for you.”
“Eh, fuck this,” the other woman said. A brunette with not as much breast size but her backside more than made up for that. Both women left.
Zoe held the gun up to the young man’s face. His blue eyes darted from left to right as if trying to nudge his body to move in one of those directions.
“I want information and I want it now,” Zoe told him. “Neural implant chips. Who is selling them on the black market?”
“Oh fuck. No… wait a minute,” the man began to say, “I know who you are. You’re the Red Nova! Yeah… you are that damn federal hacker. The best! But I can’t tell you nothing! They got eyes everywhere!”
Zoe pointed the gun at his right kneecap. She shot and it blew off the virtual bone in a red splash.
The young man cried out though his body remained still. “What the fuck! It hurts! It isn’t suppose to hurt but it does! So bad!”
“That is because I turned on your pain receptors. You will feel all the pain as if it were real life.” Zoe pointed the gun to the young man’s groin.
“Okay! Okay! Okay!” the young man said. “I can’t tell you here! I’ll V-mail you a location. Meet me there tomorrow at midnight!”
“If you try to Trojan me then I have to warn you my firewall is impenetrable.” Zoe informed him. “I will know that you tried to hack me and I’ll be very unhappy.” She straddled him and put her gun right on his crotch with the business end firmly indicating her intentions if she senses foul play.
Lithium’s eyes went blank all of a sudden as if his pupils disappeared. All but for a second then they returned and he said “Okay. It’s done.”
“Iree, does it check out?” Zoe queried.
“The file is clean and the location is valid.” Iree reported.
“Well, now,” Zoe told him. “If you think that you can slither away once I am gone just know that I have already placed a homing sign on your neural imprint. If you log on the Network I will be immediately informed and we will see each other real soon.”
She pressed her pistol a bit harder into his genitals. “And before you try to get clever just know that I have put a freeze on your credit account. I’ll lift it once me and you have had our up close and personal.”
Lithium did not respond as she stood up. She released the neural hold she had on him and then he immediately jerked in reaction to having been shot grabbing his virtual knee and cradling it as if it was real. She thought about disabling the pain receptors but decided it was best to let the seriousness of the situation play itself out.
“Jump,” she thought and immediately she was gone from the virtual club and back in her apartment.

The location that Lithium had sent her was an abandoned warehouse in District 13. She was not to fond of going to District 13 because it was the most run down of all the Districts. Even District 12,which was the immigrant district, was better kept than 13. The reason for this was the fact that 13 was the home to all the meta humans.
Meta humans were races other than humans. The Orks were large brutish humanoids with a snout instead of a nose. Their teeth were giant things that protruded from their mouth making them look more beast than man. The various Elfen races came in all sorts of flavors but you could always tell them apart from humans due to their giant ears that stuck out a quarter of a meter.
Zoe did not have a problem with meta humans as did most citizens of New Verum. It was the smell that she hated. The sewage system was never working properly and so the smell as soon as you entered the district walls was apparent and oppressive. Not to mention the whole of the district was littered with trash and ruin from little to no maintenance offered by the Federal Government. What little aid they gave was seen as charity from the other Barons and was often times used to quarantine this section off from the rest of the city.
Zoe’s bike hummed as she slowly crept down the meager street that was crowded full of pedestrians. Even though her sports bike was worth more than most of them probably could make in a year hardly anyone seemed to pay her any mind. Everyone was minding their own business trying to navigate the hustle and bustle to get to wherever it is they were going.
It was already late in the evening and Zoe wanted to make sure she was not late. She still had a few hours she knew though being early meant being able to scope out the scene ahead of time for any surprises.
After an hour or so of creeping through the meta human slums, Zoe had arrived at her destination. She pulled her bike to the back of the warehouse and from there found a fire escape that led up to the roof.
From the roof she crept down into the building from a hole that had caved in some time ago. Quietly she made her way down to the rafters.
“Iree, I need you to gauge the structural integrity of these beams.” After being queued from Zoe thinking her name, Iree did as she was instructed.
“The structural integrity of this metal appears to be sound.” Iree stated a moment later.
Zoe crept across the beams slowly while looking down below. The beams were no wider than a hand but she had no problem balancing herself on it. She prompted her visor and the crown’s bottom half lit up as a pair of goggles made of green light formed in front of her eyes. She viewed the surroundings below her.
Everything looked to be in order. There were empty boxes scattered across many tall platforms. Whatever was of value had been looted long ago. Then she saw Lithium. He was standing near a window where the only light in the warehouse was getting in from the outside. He appeared nervous and fidgety. She saw a cherry light up from a cigarette he puffed at.
She made her way over to him and climbed down on one of the platforms. She dropped a few feet beside him though did so in such a quiet fashion he did not seem to notice.
“I see you are a man of your word,” she spoke calmly.
“Oh shit!” he exclaimed as he dropped his cigarette. “You scared the shit out of me!”
She rested her hand on her sidearm that dangled on her hip which he looked at nervously. “Start talking.”
“Okay. Geez. Listen. The chips that you are after. I don’t know the full details behind them. All I know is that they were some kind of experimental prototypes that Aeon Tech was working on. Somehow they were smuggled straight out the building and there have been some cats who were able to duplicate the technology.”
“Aeon Tech?” Zoe spoke as she thought about it. Aeon Tech was the company on neural networking. They were the ones who learned how to duplicate the ancient technology left over which created the neural bands more than half the population of New Verum used. The Network itself was already in place since before the Cataclysm. The people of New Verum just adopted what was already there and made it their own.
“The people who are duplicating this technology, they are the terrorists who have been bombing the city the past year,” Zoe told him grimly.
Lithium threw his hands in there. “Oh fuck! I’m in some deep shit! Look I swear I don’t know anything about that! I just deal in pirating software. The only reason I know any of this is because this one new hacker group asked me to develop this new program for them…”
“What new hacker group?” she asked inquisitively.
“The Legion.” he said blankly.
“There are two individuals approaching!” Iree’s voice rang in Zoe’s head.
“Get down!” Zoe shouted. As she did, Lithium dropped and a shot rung out behind him as a bullet hit the wall.
“What the fuck!” he screamed as he ran behind a box.
“Stay there!” she commanded. In one quick motion she pulled her hood and mask up and then as her body suit lit up she disappeared. Her active camouflage automatically reacting to Iree’s prompt. She had pulled her auto pistol out and she sprinted in a zig zag towards the direction where the bullet had come. With her tactical goggles also activated she noticed two individuals crouching on one of the platforms.
One had a rifle and was aiming it in the direction of Lithium. He fired another shot. Zoe put up her pistol and returned fire. The .45 caliber bullet ripped into the man’s skull and blood and brain matter littered the box behind him. Immediately she fired another round at the man beside him. The bullet hit the man in the chest.
Zoe zoomed in with her visor. The man had been shot where his heart should be. Instead of dying he just stood up and ran.
“Shit!” Zoe said. He is a vampire. That’s the only explanation of how he could survive that. Vampires had the ability to regenerate all wounds instantly as long as they had a fresh supply of blood within a forty eight hour period.
Zoe pulled the clip free from her auto pistol. She put it on her tool belt and grabbed another. This clip was full of silver bullets. Silver would instantly kill a vampire if it was to come in contact with its blood.
Another bullet suddenly whizzed past Zoe. She turned around to see another sniper up in the far end of the room. He must have an infrared scope to be able to see through her active camo. Another shot rang out and grazed her arm shattering her energy shield as she dove out the way.
Damn, she thought. It would take a full minute for her energy shield to regenerate. A minute might as well be an eternity at this moment in time.
Zoe sprinted from behind the box. Several shots rung out as the sniper open fire on her. She leaped up on top of a box then up onto a platform. After the seventh shot there was a pause in the firing. Zoe took this as a sign the sniper was reloading. She aimed her pistol which was in marksman mode and fired. It hit the box the sniper was using for cover. She put a few more shots into the box for good measure. She could see the splash of an energy shield dissipating from behind the box.
She kept the pistol pointed at the box until she saw the man run out from behind it. She shot a few more times and one of the bullets hit him in the leg. She sprinted forward as he dropped to the ground. She dove forward and went prone. She lined up her shot and pulled the trigger. The bullet whizzed into the man as he stood up. She shot him square in the throat. He struggled for a brief moment and then went limp as blood spurted from his jugular.
She sprinted to where the vampire had ran. She found an open man hole. A sudden terror filled her as she contemplated pursuit. Closed spaces always filled her with dread. She shook the feeling and realized that her priority was Lithium. She quickly left and went to find him still cowering behind the box she had left him.









































Chapter 3

Azak lay trying to make sense of his surroundings. He felt hazy and distant as if his life existed now in some permanent dream state. He did his best to focus.
After much time and deliberate consideration, he figured himself to be on a cart from the sound and what he felt to be the motion of moving forward. He could not move his head and what little vision he did have was that of the sky. It went from day to night multiple times and he really had no idea how long he had been traveling. He tried to speak or cry out but his voice would not work. He could not move for that matter for his body felt completely and utterly useless. It was not long until he fell unconscious.

When he came to, he had better vision than he did before. He could see now that he was no longer on a cart, but in a bed in what appeared to be a dungeon of some sort. He tried to call out. His voice was throaty and weak. As he tried to get up and move his body resisted. His muscles felt gelatinous and it was all he could do just to move his head. ​Though his vision was still blurry, he noticed the dark and dank cell he was in had very little light. What light was available came from the outside. He could hear a drop of water fall in the corner of the room as it landed on a puddle. There were no windows but only large stone brick wall covering every side of him save for the door. Had he the strength to get up it would have been useless because the door was reinforced with steel.
He tried to call out only to find himself drifting into an unconscious state once again.

Azak awoke to the sound of the door opening. Its dull locking mechanism groaned and then the door whined as it slowly opened.
Azak’s eyes focused. He noticed his vision had all but returned. It took a bit for his eyes to adjust to the light pouring in from the doorway. He saw a man enter the room.
The man had a long black robe on and it made it hard to make out his face. From what Azak could gather, his face seemed to be a pale white and his eyes a blood shot red. The clothes he wore were also red and he had various skulls and bones adorned on his belt and sash. He carried a long staff that had a circular end with spikes coming off of it. On each spike rested a brilliant green gem.
“I see the child of Xaixuhm has finally awoken,” the man said as he approached the bed.
Azak sat up. It felt awkward to move his body once again though he did so with little effort. It was then that he noticed the skin on his hands and arms were pink and black as if they had been burned.
“Where am I?” he asked. “What happened to me?”
“You are in the Daemonium Citadel,” the man said. “Once home to the proud Dryadalis, this Citadel now serves the bidding of what you know as the Necro Fiends. Though we call ourselves a different name. The Legion of Sheol. The servants of Xaixuhm.”
Azak felt his stomach churn at that name. Had that been a dream? Surely his experience of that creature was not real. No matter how real it felt.
“I am the Dread Lord Ozragan. I serve the Supreme Xaixuhm. It was he who granted me the vision of your whereabouts. It was he who granted you life again after you met your death at the hands of the Acolyte of Deus. The one who is called Sol of the Mag Mell.”
“Why was I brought back?” Azak interrupted. He had grown tired of this man’s talking. It was all too much.
“To carry out the will of Xaixuhm, of course,” the Dread Lord told him. “Not only are you blessed with the power of the undeath, you have also been touched by the Void. The space between the otherworlds. You are no longer simply Azak the nomad. You will henceforth be known as the Voidmancer, he who is Xaixuhm’s bane made flesh.”
“What does Xaixuhm want with me? Why bring me back? He could have found another more willing follower!”
“Sol of the Mag Mell killed you. Specifically he killed you with his Aether sword. Meaning your wound is touched by the power of Aether. To put it in terms that you can understand, the power of Aether has the power to dissolve reality. Meaning the wound that you suffered has broken beyond all the rules of death and life. Our god Xiaxhum utilized this aberrant to send your soul back to the anchor of your body.
“By the time we found you, it had been a year since you had been killed. You were just a decomposed corpse only newly formed as a creature of undeath. In the months it took you to travel here and the weeks following your arrival to being at this Citadel, the power of the Void has regenerated your body. Soon you will have healed completely. All save the Aether wound which you suffer which can never be fully healed.”
Azak looked at his stomach. The wound which had killed him was closed but it remained scarred. The surrounding flesh was black and rotting as if it was fighting to infect the whole of his being. It was then he noticed the dull pain which originated from there.
“You will rest for another night,” Ozragan told him. “Then you will begin your training to become the Voidmancer.”
Dread Lord Ozragan departed leaving Azak to stare at the ceiling only to wonder what had become of his wife and daughter. The feeling that they were in possession of the monster which had given him his life back filled him with fear. There was also the feeling of somewhat certainty that they somehow had met a different fate. He knew not where this feeling came from only that it could be trusted as much as any kind of instinct could be. ​
As he lay there searching his feelings and thoughts, he could not shake the feeling of something off in the distance. It felt as if someone was at the end of a long dark hallway calling him. It was almost too distant to hear but it was there. He knew not who it was or what was being said but only what direction it was coming from. As he contemplated his newly formed existence, he drifted off again to unconsciousness.

The next morning, Azak awoke to find a strange woman in his room. She was a light skinned elfen woman. She had long pointed ears with deep blue eyes. Her hair was silver and long and her skin was fair and radiant. She wore a short revealing white robe that was transparent revealing her bosoms and genitals. She held a stack of clothes in front of her.
“Who are you?” Azak asked her as he got out of bed. He was nude but she seemed not to notice or care. He looked at his hands and skin to notice his body had completely healed himself of the burns that were there the day before. The Aether wound on his stomach was still there, however. The dull pain was apparent but Azak had built a high threshold when it came to pain as of late.
“I am Sayda,” the woman said as she handed him the clothes. “I am a Drydalis. My family were the keepers of this castle until the Necro Fiends sacked it. I serve the Dread Lord Ozragan.”
“Where are your parents?” Azak asked as he put on the black pair of pants.
“They are dead.” she said. “They were burned alive when I was a girl in accordance with the Dread Lord’s wishes.”
“And yet you serve him?” he asked.
“I have no choice,” she explained. “I am one of the last of the Drydalis. What is left of our race serve the Dread Lord. Were he to become displeased with us we would surely be wiped out.”
Azak put on the tunic and boots. Both were also black and made of leather.
“Well, then,” he said. “Where does this Dread Lord bid me?”
“Follow me,” she instructed him.
She led him down a dark and damp corridor. There were other cells on either side, all of which were empty. There were torches placed along the walls to offer very little light. It became obvious to Azak that his vision had improved in regards to seeing in the dark.
The Daemonium Citadel was a frightening wonder to behold. It was not only massive in scope but was equally foreboding. Around every corner were fierce warriors either in training or standing at the ready as if they expected that violence would erupt at any given moment. The lighting was dim everywhere they went and had not Azak’s vision been improved, he would have found it hard to navigate.
They passed by a massive beast-like man who wore thick black armor on his legs and torso and the rest of his body was covered in tattoos. He stood nearly double Azak’s height. He had a massive axe on his back.
“A rune knight,” Sayda told him. “Their markings give them power. Not only size but incredible strength. They are the most powerful warriors here besides the Dread Lord himself.”
“And what is your role in all this?” Azak asked. “I refuse to believe your only job is to bring me my clothes and lead me around.”
“Like all the Drydalis here I am a slave,” she said. “I do as the Dread Lord commands.
They continued to walk for some time until they reached the top of the staircase. She led him down a number of other corridors until they were in a very large chamber. Great stained glass windows decorated the massive walls on either side. Some were shattered while others depicted various images of Drydalis and what Azak thought to be ancient gods. As they made their way further into the chamber, he noticed other Drydalis and various other races going about their business.
“Servants of the Dread Lord,” she told him. “They will not speak to you for fear of reprisal. They will only do as they are instructed.”
They came across a large door.
“These are the personal chambers of Dread Lord Ozaragan.” she told him.
She opened the door and he stepped in. The room was dimly lit and very large. He saw a bed to his right. It was elegant and purple with two female Drydalis laying on it looking naked and afraid. There were various signs and pictographs scribbled on the floor most with candles lit circling them. He noticed a massive bookcase with hundreds of books and a large desk with various scrolls and manuscripts. Then he noticed the Dread Lord at the far end of the room standing there watching him.
“It is time to begin your training, Voidmancer,” Ozaragan told him.
Azak nodded though he still had little idea to what he was suppose to be training for.
“You are a sorcerer,” Azak said. “What use could I possibly be to one such as yourself?”
“As I told you before, you are touched by the Void. A skill that even I lack. For you see, the magic I use is that of Bael. The power of Sheol itself. Channeled through me from the Supreme Xaixuhm himself.”
“You know I really never enjoyed being lectured to,” Azak said. “So let’s just cut to it shall we? Show me this power I am suppose to have.”
“Very well,” Ozaragan said. “Close your eyes. Now I want you to envision a flame… Now a wall… If you look at the wall you will see a shadow. Your shadow. Tell me… do you see it?”
Azak concentrated. “Yes… I see it.”
“What is your shadow doing?” Ozaragan asked.
“I am… hunting sand buffalo,” Azak said as the image began to take clearer shape. “I am leading my hunting party. We have it cornered.”
“Good. What weapon are you hunting with?”
“I have a spear.”
“Now open your eyes,” Ozaragan instructed him.
Azak did so and he held a spear in his hand. It was no ordinary spear. It was made of a dark purple mist. The shape was the same as the spear he carried while he was part of the caravan. As he lost his focus the spear fizzled out and disappeared into purple smoke.
“Again,” Ozaragan said. “You will repeat this exercise until you have control over the spear and not before.”
Azak concentrated on the image again. The shadow flickered in his mind in front of the flame. He focused. When he opened his eyes he held the spear in his hand. It remained for a few moments longer than fizzled out.
“Again!” the Dread Lord’s voice rang. Azak heard what he believed to be a crack of a whip and he felt a sharp pain run down his back. He cried out and dropped to both knees taken aback by the sudden violence.
He reached back to feel his tunic had been ripped open. He felt the wound and when he looked at his hand there was blood. He turned around to see no one standing there. The Drydalis women were still on the bed but they were to far away to have done it.
“I told you that I command Bale magic,” Ozaragan said. “Now. Try again!”
Azak did so. He focused and the spear appeared and when he opened his eyes he tried to concentrate. Again the spear stayed for only a few moments longer then fizzled. The crack sounded and he dropped to his knees in pain.
“I cannot concentrate with you doing that!” he yelled in frustration.
“You will concentrate,” the Dread Lord commanded. “Failure is not an option here in the Daemonium Citadel. Again!”
Azak did the same things as before and only succeeded in keeping the spear manifested for a few moments longer. He fell to his knees as the Bale whip struck him. Each of the wounds stacking on top of each other intensifying the pain. Azak gritted his teeth and tried again.
It went on like this for an hour or so. Azak had failed to manifest the spear in a permanent state and his back showed the worse for wear. He walked with his head upright, however. He did not want any of these people to see his weakness. His anger masked the sting he felt.

Azak’s quarters had been moved to a more luxurious location of the Citadel. It was still dark and damp but the drab stone had been replaced by marble and intricately designed room decorated with Drydalic paintings. His bed was soft and comfortable though since he his body had regenerated he found he needed little sleep. Only enough for the time to take his body to regenerate the wounds he had received that day.
It wasn’t just sleep that he found no use for but food and water also. It seemed that becoming undead had relieved him of needing the fuel that mortals required. He realized that he was no longer a human being in the traditional sense. These new powers robbed him of that. Even though he was as far as he knew immortal he had been robbed of his humanity.
Sayda walked in with a fresh set of clothes for him. He stood up and put them on.
“Am I to believe you possess any sort of magical powers?” Azak asked her.
“We Drydalic lost all use of our magic when this temple was desecrated,” she told him. “Our spiritual attunement is measured by our faith for which we have none.”
Consider yourself blessed, he thought to say but did not. “It is a criminal act for the Dread Lord to have treated your people so.”
“Please do not let anyone else hear you say that,” she said. “I beg you.”
“Of course. I just wanted you to know.”
They did not speak for the rest of the morning. She led him back to the Dread Lord’s personal chambers. It had been a week since his first training session here. Each day had left him with fresh cuts on his back. His body regenerated it at night and in the morning he would return. Each day his progress slowly showed.
After his training session he was allowed limited access to roam the Citadel. Everything he had saw up to this point only added to his suspicion that the Dread Lord and his Necrofiends were truly monsters made flesh.
He had seen torture and murder and all sorts of other unholy acts be committed in his short stay here. The Drydalis were never harmed at least not permanently. He would see them beat but only to the point of bruising. They had become completely submissive to their current state of affairs.
Azak had not. He walked into the chambers. The Dread Lord stood there with his arms behind his back. His naked slaves cowered on the bed. Azak approached the Dread Lord.
“You show promise, Voidmancer,” the Dread Lord said. “You still have a long way to go if you are to be the effective disciple that Xiaxuhm promised.”
“Well, I would not want to disappoint Xiaxuhm,” Azak said barely masking his sarcasm. The Bale whip snapped in front of him, a bright red thing crackling fast and furiously. It hit him in his face right across the eye. He fell to the ground and realized it had completely ruined his right eye. The would regenerate, he knew. It still hurt like hell.
“You take great risks,” Ozaragan said. “It is to be expected with your new found gift. I want to assure you though, Voidmancer, that if you disrespect Lord Xiaxuhm in my presence again I will make you wish you had never been reborn.”
Azak stood up. His eye socket throbbed. He formed a Voidspear in his hand. He clutched it tightly. He could no longer suppress his rage and he charged. The Dread Lord seemed to pay little heed to him.
A bolt of red cackling energy sent him flying across the room originating from Ozaragan’s eyes. Azak took the blow in his chest and he could feel the burns. It wasn’t a mortal wound, he thought. The burns were sever though and his flesh was pink and muscles were exposed. He stood up again and formed the Voidspear.
He threw the spear across the room aiming for the Dread Lord. The eyebeams crackled again evaporating the spear and hitting Azak in the groin. This time he could not get up.
“You show improvement, Voidmancer,” Ozaragan said. “However, you are much too foolish. Even were you to master your powers you cannot hope to defeat me. I have survived the darkness and been given the power of Bale. It is the lifeblood of Ozaragan himself. What you have seen is only a fraction of the power at my command. Your magic has only just manifested. You will show restraint tomorrow and from now on.”
A little while later a Rune Knight in red armor entered the room to find Azak laying in a heap of burnt flesh. He paid little heed to Azak’s injuries as he picked him up like a rag doll and threw him over his shoulders.
He carried Azak back to his room and tossed him on the bed like one would do a sack of potatoes.
“You got some balls, Voidmancer,” the Rune Knight said as he laughed. “At least you had some!”
He departed laughing and Azak could hear his bellowing for a long while as he lay there contemplating his own state of affairs.

Azak practiced his skills everyday. He continued training and honing his new powers. He was able to make both spear and sling as easily as he would take in a breath. His spear being a solid dark purple as well as his sling. With the sling he was able to form stones which could be thrown.
The Dread Lord Ozaragan was not thoroughly impressed by the feats but he hide his impatience well, or so Azak thought.

Every day Azak would be summoned to the Dread Lord’s private chambers to drill his powers. It was like clockwork and each day he felt himself gaining more confidence with this Void magic. It was becoming a part of him just as much as his ​arm or leg.
Every day too, Sayda would greet him with his newly washed clothes. She would wait patiently as he would get dressed. Azak always felt a world of sadness coming off of her. It served only to mask the great anger he had stirring inside of him.
“One day, me and you will leave this place,” he had told her.
She stood there not saying anything.
“How does that make you feel?” he asked.
“I feel nothing,” was all she said.
“I am not like the others. I know you see this. This Dread Lord and the ones he command... They are wicked. This is not a place for one such as you. You are a good person. I can feel that.”
She neither said nothing nor looked directly at him. He let it go at that. He wanted desperately to plant the seed of trust within her. He wanted to have an ally in this place of depravity.

“It is now time to put your skills to test in battle,” the Dread Lord had told him. “I will be sending you out with the next warband.”
“I am eager to serve,” Azak said as sincerely as he could muster.
“Yes, “Ozaragan said. “We shall see. I am putting you under the care of my most trusted warchief. A Rune Knight named Rook. I am sure you have seen the Rune Knights in your time at the Citadel.”
“I have, my Lord.”
“Good. Your mission is to bring back something very valuable. This loot is sought after the one who gave you that,” the Dread Lord pointed at Azak’s stomach indicating he meant the wound. “Oh yes. If you succeed, there is a good chance your old adversary will bring the fight to us at the Citadel. Where we will crush him!”
“Then I will perform doubly as hard, my Lord,” Azak assured him.
“Good.” Ozaragan said. “You leave in the morning. I know you do not require sleep but the rest of us do. I still want you in your quarters at night. You have not proven yourself to be trustworthy. After this mission that could change.”

He laid until morning when he heard the knock at the door. It was Sayda, he knew because it was the same as every other morning.
“Come,” he said. She walked into the room holding his stack of clothes and robe. Her revealing robe clung to her accentuating her near perfect figure.
“The Dread Lord has commanded you are to meet with the leader of the warband at the entrance to the Citadel,” she told him. “I can show you the way.”
He took the clothes from her and set them on the bed. He stood there in the nude in front of her and as always she seemed to take no notice.
“You are broken,” he told her. “Your people have been mutilated. Why is it that you still serve Ozaragan?”
“Why is it that you serve him?” she asked blankly.
“I do it to bide my time and gain power!” he snapped. “The only thing that I care about now is my revenge. I do not give a damn about the Necro Fiends or anything else for that matter. You and your people have nothing to lose. He has already taken everything of value!”
“It started as just survival, I suppose,” she said as she looked away. It was the first time Azak had seen her ashamed. She did still feel emotion, he realized. “After the decades went by it just became habit. The fire that we had in our souls which was our faith has all but died out.”
“Decades?” he whispered. “How old are you?”
“I am one hundred and fourty,” she said. “The Dread Lord and his warband sacked the Temple when I was but sixteen. For a Drydalis that is the equivalent of a child. For those of us who were children, he kept as slaves. The rest were burned as an offering in consecration of the temple to the Demon King.”
He approached her slowly. He put his hand on her cheek and gently turned his head toward his. She looked at him and he leaned forward. As he did so, she winced.
“Don’t worry,” he said. He embraced her and she began to sob. He squeezed her as her tears ran like a river. He held her for many minutes until she stopped.
“Ozaragan will pay,” he promised her. “They will all pay for what they have done to us.”
She nodded. He didn’t think she believed him. He could not blame her for that.












































Chapter 4

Zoe made her way into the Intelligence Agency Complex. It was a towering building with over one hundred floors and dozens of departments that upheld the Federal Union’s authority.
She reached the elevator and said her name. The elevator zipped up to the one hundred and tenth floor. This was the Covert Operations to which she was a ranking member. She stepped off the elevator into the hustle and bustle which was going on.
The various offices and cubicles were ripe with activity as Zoe passed by them. They gave little notice to her as everyone was entrenched in their own business. She made her way to the interrogation room. She stepped inside the viewing bay whose occupants were sipping coffee and looking at the blonde man who sat on the other side of the glass.
“How is he?” Zoe asked.
A shorter man with glasses looked at her. “Well, we managed to get an I.d. on him finally. The hacker known as Lithium is none other than Jonas Linkovich.”
“Has he spilled the beans on the software that he wrote for the Legion?” she asked.
“Indeed, he has,” the man said. “It seems that Mr. Linkovich was approached via v-mail to produce a trojan which would allow corresponding neural recipients to engage in audio and video espionage. Most specifically targeting Frontier Genetics Enterprises. The mega corporation that specializes in… well… genetic research and manipulation.”
“I am going to have a chat with Mr. Linkovich,” she told the onlookers.
She stepped into the room and Lithium looked up at her. He still looked as nervous and peevish as ever, Zoe thought.
“Look,” he said holding up his shackled hands. “I’ve told them everything I know. You can’t just hold me here without some kind of warrant or something.”
Zoe sat in the chair across the table from him. She stared hard as she slowly sat down.
“They can hold you for as long as I tell them too,” she explained. “The truth is you are in a lot of trouble Mr. Linkovich. And seeing as how I still have your virtual accounts on lock down the only lawyers you will be able to afford are public defenders.”
Lithium buried his face in his hands. “I can help you,” he said finally. “These guys… the Legion or whatever you are calling them… they had me make this software program for them. To spy on the genetic research facility. They gave me their neural addresses so I could build anchors into the program. I can give you those.”
“See that you do,” Zoe said. “In the meantime I will make sure they feed you and make you comfortable as possible.”
“Can you get me some smokes?” he pleaded. “I’m dying here.”
“You will give the neural addresses to an agent that will come in shortly. If it checks out I’ll see what I can do.”

Zoe left the interrogation room and made her way to the Administrator’s Office. She took a seat outside and waited for the secretary to give her the clear it was okay to go inside. She walked in to see the Administrator sitting behind his desk with a slender woman standing to his left. She sat in front of his desk.
Administrator Walker was a tall and older man. He had rigid features and a bald head. He wore a black suit and even sitting down, he almost equaled the height of the woman standing next to him.
The woman was shorter than Zoe by a head. She had short black hair with two long hair pieces coming down on either side in front of her ears. She had very pale skin and wore dark blue eye shadow and lipstick. She wore a black cape with a Federal Agent uniform. Hers did not come equipped with a shield generator or active camouflage.
“I want to congratulate you, Zoe,” Administrator Walker began. “Your efficiency in capturing the data slicer Lithium is truly admirable.”
“Thank you, Administrator,” Zoe said.
“Which brings me to the next order of business,” he continued. “The corpses that we pulled out of the warehouse from the men who attacked you, they both wore tattoos on their hands indicating them as clergy of the Church of the Second Cataclysm. It is imperative that we find the connection, if there is any, of the Church’s involvement with the Legion.
“That is why I have called special agent Eva here. She is our top ranking Occult Investigator. She will be your partner until we get this matter cleared up.”
“Partner?” Zoe asked taken aback. “With all due respect, Administrator, I work best alone.”
“I am aware of that,” he told her. “However, given the nature of what has transpired, we all must make sacrifices for the security of New Verum. Agent Eva here is a more than capable officer. She is also a skilled mage. Agent Eva, if you would give her your credentials.”
The woman nodded with a smile. “I am pleased to meet you agent Zoe,” she said. “Your reputation precedes you. As far as my credentials, I was registered as an Esper when I was thirteen years old. I was sent to the Mages’ Consortium where I trained for eight years. I have earned the title of warlock. Since then I spent the last four years at the Military Academy training to become both a Federal Agent and an Occult Investigator.”
“So you don’t even have any field experience?” Zoe winced.
“This will be my first operation, that is correct,” she said. Still smiling.
Zoe hated magic. She hated having a partner. She looked at the shorter woman noticing how beautiful she was. Normally that would be in a person’s favor trying to win over Zoe’s affection but now it only served to annoy her further.
“I must protest,” Zoe told the Administrator.
“Your objection is noted, Agent Renvar. Now unless you would like me to pull rank, I suggest you take Miss Eva here under your wing and let her expertise be of service to both you and the Federation.”
Zoe fought back the comment she wanted to say. Instead she nodded. “If there is anything else, Sir?”
“That will be all, Agent Renvar.”

Zoe and Eva made their way to the parking garage. Zoe would have to leave her sports bike here and would be forced to drive one of the Federation Model Cars. Though they had the speed of her bike, she disliked the inconvenience of having to drive one. They got in the car with Zoe insisting she be the one to drive.
Zoe plotted the destination in the positioning system and the car began its route. While she could have overridden the automatic driving system she did not have the patience at the moment to contend with traffic.
“Let’s get one thing straight,” Zoe said. “When we are out in the field I call the shots. I don’t care if you are an Esper or warlock or whatever.”
“That is acceptable,” Eva said. She still had that smile. What was she smiling about, Zoe wondered. “I am honored to be working with you Miss Renvar.”
“Call me Zoe. I am not Miss Renvar.”
“Okay, Zoe. It’s a pleasure. I am sure that once we break the ice between us, you will find me to be a capable agent and a valuable asset.”
“We’ll see,” Zoe said. “Tell me about this Church of the Cataclysm.”
“Certainly,” Eva said. “The Church of the Second Cataclysm is a new religion here in New Verum. It started originally in the Wastelands and from our studies, it came from somewhere far to the northwest beyond the Pestilent Sea. The Church has since grown expeditiously while in the city. They are a polytheistic religion who believe that the god of Deus is fighting a supernatural battle in the afterlife against the other gods. They believe that once he is victorious he will return to the planet and break it just like the first Cataclysm that destroyed the world. Only his followers will be saved from the destruction.”
“Great…” Zoe mused.
“Where are we headed?” Eva asked.
“Aeon Technologies. I want to find out as much as we can about this Neural Implant Chip.”
“Well if there is anything to be discovered I am sure you will find it. You are legendary, Zoe. Your skills as a hacker as well as an agent are taught by the professors at the Academy.”
“Well that is very nice of them,” Zoe said dryly. “I appreciate the compliments, Eva. I just don’t work well with others.”
“It’s okay.” Eva said with that smile again. “I don’t take it personal.”

They arrived at Aeon Technologies. Zoe parked the car outside the building. She instructed the security guard that they were on Federation business. They entered the building and were escorted to the Research and Development part of the building. It was located on the fifty-first floor which they reached via elevator. After arriving there, they were greeted by a young man in his late twenties. He had glasses and brown hair he wore in a comb over.
“Greetings, Agent Renvar,” He said with a sheepish smile. “If we had more ample notice of your arrival we would have had a better welcoming than security for you.”
“Let’s skip the pleasantries,” Zoe said as she walked through the floor observing the various technologies and projects going on. Eva followed her coolly while the young man with glasses struggled to keep up with them.
“Of course,” he told her. “What is it that you are here for exactly? I mean… just so we know what it is we can do for you.”
“I want to know about the Neural Implant Chips you developed,” Zoe said as she stopped suddenly turning to face the man. “They were stolen some time ago and I want to know what their capabilities are and who took them.”
The man cowered nervously while pushing his glasses up. “Of course. Of course! Yes, I can help you with that. The chips were known as the Neuron Integration System. It was developed as a means to make the Network become streamlined into reality via the operator. Meaning… that one would have access to the Network without having to dive. While they still had the ability to dive if they so chose, they could access an array of functions while in the real world. The only problem was that if they were to dive in the Network and sustain a life threatening injury then their brain functions would cease.”
“So you mean if they died in the Network they die in real life?” Zoe asked.
“That is correct,” the man said.
“Who stole the chips?”
“Well, we have never quite figured that out to be honest,” the man said. “We have hired various private investigators and rechecked security logs but we still remain unsure as to how the heist was made.”
“Could there have been magic involved?” Eva asked.
“Magic?” the man asked confused. “Well… we didn’t think about that. I guess it’s possible. But wouldn’t the Mages’ Consortium be able to detect that sort of thing?”
“The Mages’ Consortium do have the ability to detect magic being used in the city,” Eva explained. “Though if it was one who had been sanctioned to use magic by the Consortium then their usage would go unnoticed.”
“How would one go about getting a license?” Zoe asked.
“That could be either going to the Consortium itself or Barons have the ability to grant licenses as they see fit.”
“Would you be able to detect any usage of magic?” Zoe asked her.
“If it was within a few hours then sure,” she said. “Seeing as how it has been months since this supposed heist then no way.”
“Great…” Zoe said. She looked at the young man again. “I want you to v-mail me at this address all the schematics and details of the chips. Also compile all the data your investigators have done on the heist. Is that understood?”
“Uh… yes ma’am,” he said.
“Good.” Zoe said. She looked at Eva. “Let’s go.”

They made their way to the Basilica of Deus. From what Eva had explained, it was the headquarters of the Church of the Second Cataclysm. There they would find Archbishop Wido, the head of the church in New Verum.
It had begun raining by the time they reached the basilica. They parked the car and walked into the front entrance. There was mass going on when they entered. They sat in the back of the church to listen on.
A man stood at the podium. Behind him was the statue of a knight holding a giant sword upright. Around him were various gargoyle and demon-like statues all bowing down as if worshiping the knight. There were stained glass windows all throughout the church each depicting some kind of apocalyptic battle between the knight and other warriors or creatures. Zoe figured the knight to be Deus.
“The man at the pulpit is Archbishop Wido,” Eva whispered to her.
Archbishop Wido was a rather fat man, Zoe thought. His face was round and his eyes had bags under them as if he had deprived himself of a week’s worth of sleep. His cheeks were chubby and he wore a gloom expression as he gazed onto the congregation who seemed eager for the Archbishop to start his sermon.
“Ladies and gentlemen!” the Archbishop said, his voice booming through the church. “Welcome to the house of the Lord!”
The people cheered wildly. Archbishop Wido waited for the cheers to die down before he continued.
“For many of you, this is only one of many sermons that you have participated in. For others, it may be your first time to be graced with the essence that is our Lord Deus. Whichever you may be, you are welcome in the house of the Lord. We are all children of the great and wise Deus! For you see, we are his children. And Lord Deus loves his children!”
Again the crowd went wild. Zoe rolled her eyes as the people struggled to calm down. Once they did, the archbishop went on with his sermon.
“Neo Verum has become a cesspool. A place for vermin and filth to breed and wallow in false security and blasphemous technology! They have forgotten the true purpose of their creation! They do not realize why the Lord Deus has created us! They are dust in the wind! They are vapors in the ocean! Their time is nigh! The Old World was destroyed by the First Cataclysm and remade to the Wastelands we see now! This is all as Lord.
“Why would our Lord bring about all this destruction, some may ask. Well, to these heretics I say this… You have angered our god! You have forced his hand to act this way! With your defiance and idolatrous ways, you paved the way for your own destruction. Take solace in the fact though that in this great cleansing there shall be a rebirth. This rebirth is called the Second Cataclysm.
“With the Second Cataclysm, this filthy hovel of a planet shall be washed away in an instant. What is left will be ash and ruin. And we, the faithful and chosen, shall be called up! We shall reach the Celestial Realm where we shall push out the false gods that have occupied it and imprisoned our true Lord! Oh they are but a fraction of the power of Deus. Even with their combined might, they have not been successful in defeating him. Their time… just like the time of New Verum… is coming to a close.
“Now I say! Who is ready for the Second Cataclysm?!” the archbishop’s voice boomed and the crowd shouted and screamed. People ran to the altar and prostrated themselves before the statues and the Archbishop. Some cheered and some wept. It was a spectacle unlike anything Zoe had ever witnessed.
“The Second Cataclysm is coming! Show us the floods, Lord Deus! Give us fire and destruction! Let the stars fall and oceans overturn! Let the volcanoes erupt in harmony with the hurricanes! Destroy this filthy planet so that we may be free!”

After the service had ended, the Archbishop spent the next two hours blessing people and offering them brief words of wisdom while listening to people pledge their loyalty to Deus. Zoe informed one of the ushers that she was on federal business and it was urgent she speak to the archbishop in private.
The man approached the archbishop and whispered in his ear. Archbishop Wido nodded and departed through a door in the back. The man returned to Zoe.
“The Archbishop will see you in his private quarters,” the man told her. He led Zoe and Eva to the door and they entered. It was a small corridor and the man led them down. There were two other men in black robes on either side of another door. They stood solemn and paid little heed to Zoe or Eva.
“The Archbishop will see you now,” one of the men said and opened the door.
Zoe walked in first. The room was not very large and was dark. The only light came from a few candles on the archbishop’s desk. The archbishop himself sat behind the desk and looked at Zoe with a smile that made a chill run down her spine.
“You have to forgive my rudimentary study,” Archbishop Wido said. “I am a simple man who believes in practical quarters.”
“My name is Zoe Renvar. I am here on behalf of the Federal Union of New Verum. We have come to suspect that members of your clergy have become part of an underground terrorist group.”
The archbishop continued to smile at her without blinking.
“Does this not come as a surprise?” Zoe asked. “ It is a capital offense to harbor terrorists knowingly.”
“I know not of what clergy you speak of,” the archbishop said holding his hands up as if surrendering. “We are a peaceful religion and would never practice violence against the state.”
“Well given your fiery rhetoric in your sermon, one has to wonder if all the members of your clergy feel the same.”
“I cannot speak on behalf of everyone involved with our extensive organization. I can only say that as a man of faith, it is beyond my capacity to willingly commit a crime which would lead to violence against one of my fellow citizens.”
“So tell me,” Zoe said slowly. “Do you know of a Bishop Cargile and Priest Geralt?”
The archbishop sat slowly back in his chair. The smile faded from his face. “Why, of course I know them,” he said. “They were excommunicated only three months ago.”
“Excommunicated?” Zoe pondered. “On what grounds.”
“Well that is a private matter,” he said. Zoe scowled and he continued. ”However, we have nothing to hide and it would be in our best interest to see this matter concluded. Both Bishop Cargile and Priest Geralt were involved with preaching blasphemy and apostasy. The bishop you see... Was under the impression that Lord Deus was in fact not a god at all. He had gained this notion that our great Lord was a Devil. When we learned of his preaching this sort of sacrilege, we were left with little choice but to excommunicate him.”
“There are records to prove this?” Zoe asked.
“We do not keep records,” the Archbishop said as if speaking to a child. “You see our faith comes from beyond the practices of New Verum. Most of our original apostles could neither read nor write. To start meticulously keeping records of our doings would be a breech of tradition.”
“I see...” Zoe said. This was getting nowhere, she thought.
“If that is all Miss Renvar? I am afraid I have a great many things to do and I assure you that if anything were to come up in regards to either Cargile or Geralt, we will inform the authorities without delay.”
Zoe and Eva were led out of the Basilica fairly quick. It had seemed they have overstayed their welcome, Zoe mused. They began walking to their car.
“You know he is lying, right?” Eva said.
“No doubt. I’ll see to it that our friend Archbishop Wido is monitored closely. Until then there is not much we can do.”

Zoe dropped off Eva on her side of town which was three districts away. By the time she returned to her own apartment it was nightfall. She made her way up annoyed by the fact she had to leave her bike at the agency. The whole day had gotten her wound up but she took in a deep breath.
She walked into her apartment and Kit greeted her.
“No dinner yet?” she asked him as she walked in the living room.
“Well, I wasn’t sure what you had the taste for,” Kit explained. I tried to call you via your neural crown but I got no answer.”
“Oh,” Zoe said. “Well I will check it out later. Maybe there is a glitch.”
She sighed as she took off the neural crown and set it on the table. She walked into her room and took off her clothes. She stepped into the bathroom.
“Bath. Medium warm,” she said. The tub began to fill. Then she remembered, “Bubbles.”
She sighed. “It was a hell of a day, Kit,” she called out. He came walking in.
“You weren’t shot again were you?” he asked.
“No,” she said as she stepped into the tub. “Had a crazy run in with a preacher. The shit people believe...”
“Well, is it okay if I don’t cook tonight?” Kitt asked.
“What?” she asked. “You cook every night.”
“Yes, but I saw this nice restaurant that delivers, I am sure you would love it.”
“Fine. Do what you want,” she said. She slipped down into the tub letting the warm water soak into her skin. She lay there for a half an hour and finally washed all the grim and smut from her body. Roaming the city always left her feeling dirty. The pollution was only getting worse and she did love being clean.
She got out the tub and dried her body with a towel which she used to wrap up her hair. She walked out to the bedroom. She looked on the bed for her change of clothes and they were not there. She stood there in the nude feeling frustrated. She stormed back into the living room.
“What is going on with you?” she demanded.
“Whatever do you mean?” Kit asked. “Why are you naked? You are going to catch a cold.”
She marched over to him. “Because you didn’t put out my clothes.” She said becoming increasingly agitated. “You have had the same routine for two years and now you want to go changing things up. Why?”
“Well...” Kit said, “I...”
“You what?” she asked as he stopped mid sentence.
“I... I...I...” he repeated.
“Kit?” she asked becoming concerned. “Kit?!”
Kit’s eyes went blank and then turned red. Zoe gasped and he reached out and grabbed her by the throat. She grabbed his wrists and he lifted her up into the air.
“You’re... Choking...” she tried to say though it came out as a squeak.
As he had her dangling up in the air, he quickly charged forward slamming her into the wall. The towel flew from her head and what air she had in her lungs was forced from her. She almost fell unconscious at the force of it all. She struggled to release his grip but he was much too strong. She tried lifting her feet and kicking him but that also proved fruitless. She felt her life slipping away from her...
“Zozo...” Kit whispered. “Zozo!”
He loosened his grip some. Enough for her to gasp for air.
“Zozo, I am not in control!” he said as his eyes came back into focus. “Someone has hacked me! I am fighting it but...”
“Stop it... Kit!” she gasped. “You’re... Hurting me!”
He released his grip and she dropped to the floor.
“Run!” he screamed as he clutched his head. “Get out of here!”
She sprinted to the table. His eyes turned red again and he leaped forward. By that time she had put her neural crown back on. In a split second she had prompted Iree to come online and invade Kit’s hardware all in the span of a thought. Kit froze in place.
Isolate the virus, Zoe commanded and Iree did so.
Put a trace on the hacker, she commanded. There was a brief pause.
Unable to locate, Iree told her. The hacker is gone.
Damn, Zoe thought. He was gone that fast. Whoever it was, was a skilled hacker. Not as skilled as her but damn close in order to have the ability to hack Kit.
“Kit...” she said as she approached his lifeless body. “Looks like we have some work to do, Iree.”































Chapter 5

The warband that Azak traveled with was made up of about thirty men. Most of whom were known as acolytes which means they were ordinary foot soldiers. They wore plate armor and carried various weapons that included swords and spears mostly. The officers had rifles but they also carried melee weapons. They seemed the sort to prefer killing up close and personal when the opportunity arose.
Then there were the three Rune Knights. They were giant men that Azak had already seen, standing double his height and carrying massive weapons. The one leading the warband was a particularly fearsome knight named Rook. He wore bright red armor and carried a massive hammer. His face looked like it was chiseled from stone. He had a scar on his right eye that Azak suspected had resulted in the same punishment Azak had gotten for defying the Dread Lord.
Azak’s groin had only recently fully regenerated. Not that Rook seemed to know or perhaps he didn’t care at all.
“You obey me, Voidmancer!” he had told him before they set out. “You might have the balls of a eunuch but I know your type like to get clever when there seems an opportunity to escape. You try it and I will rip your spine out through your ass!”
They had been marching for a week. Their direction seemed to be south east from what Azak could tell. They had only recently come out of the Bleaklands which was a hazardous journey in and of itself. The crags and mountain passes the group had to cross had already killed two acolytes. There was very little game or water either. Now that they had reached the Arid Plains they would run into the occasional wildlife. They had not seen any humans as of yet who knew better than to venture this far north.
One of the acolytes spoke to Azak, a man he had come to know as Lupe. He was a shorter man though he seemed quite agile. He had black hair and a tan similar to Azak. Probably another nomad.
“All this damned marching day and night,” he said “With barely time to sleep or piss. It’s like we’ve died and gone to hell.”
Azak thought about the irony. “There is a sandstorm coming,” he said.
“What? Really? That’s fucking great.”
They marched for another hour and the sandstorm was seen on the horizon.
“Dig your trench and get down!” Rook barked.
Everyone pulled out their spades and began to dig frantically. The sandstorm was coming fast and they knew they had very little time to prepare.
“Come,” Azak told Lupe. “We can build a better hole together!”
Lupe did not argue and they quickly had dug a decent size hole to squat into. The sand blew over them viciously. The hole offered little cover but they were fairing better than the others whose meager holes caused them to have to put their heads down in the sand.
“This is fucking awful!” Lupe yelled.
The sandstorm raged on for another four hours until it subsided. It was nightfall then and everyone was quiet. Most had fallen asleep, Azak figured.
Slowly Azak crawled out of his hole. As he did, he found the towering figure of Rook standing over him.
“Don’t get any bright ideas, Voidmancer,” he said. “I might require sleep but I always have someone watching you. Were you to try and escape well…” He brandished his massive hammer and laughed.
“Alright you twats!” Rook roared. “We are going to rest here for four hours then we will move out! That should be more than enough time to shit and sleep!”
Azak slipped back down into his hole. He found Lupe was looking at him smiling.
“Yeah, that big fucker has got a liking to you,” he said. He brushed his long black hair attempting to shake the sand out of it.
“Something like that,” Azak declared. “What do you know about these Rune Knights?”
“Know about them?” Lupe thought. “Oh, don’t even think about it! Those tattoos are more than just for show. Not only does it make them big like that but those fuckers are beasts. They are already stronger than us but once those tattoos go all flashy then there is no stopping them.”
“Can they be killed?” Azak asked.
“Well, sure,” Lupe said. “I seen one bite the dust only a few months back. We attacked a warband and one of them put a bullet right in the head of one of the Knights. Well, sure as shit, killed him on the spot.”
“So they are mortal,” Azak said.
“Oh, sure, but let me tell you, Rook is no ordinary Rune Knight. If you was too shoot him in the head… maybe you would kill him… but then again… I’d put my money on him getting right back up. I seen him plow through ten men at one time like it was grass. That big hammer just crushed every single one with a swipe.”

The rest of the night Azak just lay there looking up at the stars. He had no injury so there was no need to regenerate. He thought about his wife and baby. He thought about how he would escape from these people and where he would go. They might be enemies of the marauders that killed his family but they were still monsters and Azak did not want to become like that even if he had become a creature of undeath. He would just have to bide his time for now and wait for his chance.

The next morning they set out. It was still dark but no one dared to complain. Rook ordered them to eat on the move. Azak had no need for food so he gave his rations to Lupe. Despite being an acolyte Lupe was not so bad, Azak thought. He had information and also a sense of humor and that took the edge off if only a little bit.
“Got fucking sand in my boots!” he would complain. Or “This bullshit marching has got my ass chapped!”
Azak just took the time to study Rook. The lumbering beast-man was a sight to behold and so was his armor. Azak could not find a weakness in it, at least not by observing it from this distance. While his arms and legs were exposed, his head was the only vulnerable spot.
They marched until noon when Rook raised his hand to order an all stop. He held his hand out beckoning for everyone to come to him.
“This is it,” Rook told them. “That’s the caravan we are after. Kill and loot everything you see. Except for a girl with green hair. Do not harm her in anyway. If you do then I will rip off your dick and shove it up your ass.”
No one thought he meant that in any way but the literal sense.
“Alright, acolytes, move out!” he cried out and they all charged.
The warband did as they were commanded and rushed headlong into battle. As Azak came upon the tents he found it to be more of a slaughter, however. Men, women, and children were being cut down without hesitation. Azak looked on with disgust.
“Get your weapon out and fight,” one of the Rune Knights commanded him. Azak formed his voidspear and the giant seemed satisfied and went back to killing.
“Don’t let Rook see you standing about or there will be hell to pay,” Lupe said approaching. He had blood on his sword. “I know this is brutal work but it’s either us or them.”
“I won’t kill innocents.”
“It’s your neck,” Lupe said running off.
Azak turned around to see a little girl running. She was being chased by two acolytes. She was crying and screaming and one of the acolyes grabbed her. Azak assumed her age to be maybe seven or eight. The men took her to tent. The flap was open and Azak could see the man pin her down and drop his pants.
Azak’s voidspear disappeared and was replaced with a sling. He twirled it a few times and launched a shadowy stone. The aim was true and it hit the man in the temple knocking him over dead. Azak had already begun charging by the time the other man had turned around to see what exactly happened. The acolyte raised his sword but it was too late because Azak had formed up the voidspear again skewering him.
“Voidmancer!” a voice thundered. It was Rook. Apparently he had seen at least some of what transpired. Azak saw him charging towards him. “What the fuck are you doing?!”
Azak turned to see the little girl running off and felt a bit of relief. He turned back towards the giant and said, “I was stopping those men from raping little girls.”
“What?” Rook laughed. “Are you stupid or do you just want to test my tenacity?”
Azak said nothing. Rook backhanded him across the face planting him firmly in the ground.
“You speak when I talk to you, Voidmancer!”
Azak spit out blood and a few teeth. “My apologies, Rune Knight.”
“Get your ass up,” Rook said. Azak did so. Rook turned and took a few steps back. “You want a piece of me?”
“That was not my aim.”
“Well, too bad! Though since I am a man of indulgence I will give you the first hit.”
Azak considered it. It did not seem there was to be any way of talking his way out of this. He let out a sigh and formed his voidsling. He twirled it a few times and let a shadowy stone fly. It all happened so fast that Rook did not have time to react. The stone hit him squarely in the forehead. The massive giant fell on his back.
Quickly Azak had a voidspear in his hand and rushed forward. He leapt into the air and onto Rook’s chest. He lifted the spear high with the tip pointing down. He was a moment away from shoving it into the giant’s throat when a massive hand reached up and swatted him away. He went flying into a tent and it came crashing down around him. He struggled to get up and did so but only after a few moments fighting the tent. He saw Rook had already stood up and was rubbing his forehead.
“You clever little twat,” he said. “I have to give you that one. It’s been a long time since someone knocked me on my ass!” The giant laughed.
Azak formed the voidspear once more and charged. The giant swung a huge fist at him. Azak ducked and rolled coming up behind him. He poked with his spear driving it into the knight’s calf. It drew blood but it was not a serious wound. His skin was tougher than leather, Azak thought.
Just as soon as he drew back the giant came around with another fist. Azak backpedalled away quickly. Down came the Rune Knight’s foot in a stomp almost crushing Azak. He rolled to the side and struck with his spear again, this time in the groin. The spear did not penetrate his armor.
“You little shit!” Rook clamored. He pulled his hammer off his back and flaunted it in front of him. “You see this? This means it’s your ass!”
Rook swung the hammer and Azak barely got out the way. The reach on it was astonishing considering the size of both it and the giant’s arm. Rook swung it round and round forcing Azak on the retreat. He thought about turning to run but it was too late. A blow of the hammer hit him in the arm shattering his bones. As he staggered the giant spun way to quickly for someone of that size and as he came around he brought the full force of his hammer into Azak’s chest. Every rib he had turned into jelly and he was launched into the air. As he landed he bounced like some rag doll. He struggled to stay conscious though it was to little avail.
His last memory is that of Rook standing over him saying, “Too bad you are the Dread Lord’s little pet. Otherwise we would see if your skull could regenerate after being shattered into a million pieces.”

The world went dark and Azak fell. He recognized his surroundings to be the hell he had went to when he was killed back before he became the Voidmancer. As he splashed into the water and felt the torrent take him, he made little effort to resist it. He did not feel the terror as he did before. This time it all seemed different. This time it seemed as if he was not himself. It felt, rather, as if he was watching himself, as if in a dream.
The time passed as he traveled the river. The violence of it all still remained but the emotions were not. He just let it all happen. He fell down the waterfall and did not care about what awaited him.
After many hours or perhaps days he looked around only to find himself not in a river, but caught in some giant web. It was more a curiosity to him than anything else. Whatever had caught him had done a thorough job because he could not move at all. From his limited perspective, he viewed his surroundings. He appeared to be in a vast ocean of darkness on top and under, what he thought, was some more massive version of the web he was caught in.
That is when he saw her. Though her was a relative term because it had the top half of a woman and the bottom half of a spider. It was a huge creature with a black spidery body. It had eight legs that were long and incessant looking. The abdomen was a giant black mass with pulsing red veins. On the posterior, the woman half- connected to the mass of the body.
Azak studied her curiously. The woman was beautiful if one was to happen upon her unaware of her lower self. She had long black hair and delicate looking features. Her eyes were a bright red as were her lips. Her breasts were plump and supple. She looked at Azak intensely as she crawled slowly to him as a predator would stalk its prey.
“Oh, what good tidings are caught in my web,” she said as she leaned in on him. She got closer and closer eyeing Azak up and down as if dissecting him with her eyes. “Oh, the Voidmancer! Surely, you would make for a fine meal?”
Azak said nothing. He could not move and he would not beg. He was already dead so he knew it was pointless. He was already at her complete mercy.
“Are you not frightened of me?” she asked. Her voice was pleasant and inviting. “Then you are as brave as they say.”
Her human body was now paralleled with his. She came in close to almost touching him. They were eye to eye now.
“I am Ibizail,” she said as she began to caress Azak’s cheek. “You are the Voidmancer. The one they called Azak. He who lives between worlds.”
“Are you one of Xiaxuhm’s servants?” Azak asked her.
She slapped him. “I am no one’s servant!” she hissed. She grabbed his face and pulled it to make him look directly at her. “Xiaxuhm would have you believe he is the King of all Demons. He is only one of many Demon Kings. Here in Gehenna where we demons reside, in the endless gulf of suffering, we all fight for supremacy. Xiaxuhm has his dominion in the further reaches. You are in my domain.”
Her voice became soft and soothing again. “We all have our principalities here but you do not have to fear me, Voidmancer. Oh no. In fact, I think that if you are wise you will come to find that I am your greatest ally.”
“I am through being a puppet of whatever machinations you demons play with each other,” Azak said. “I am tired. And I did not ask for this.”
She leaned forward and whispered in his ear. “Oh, but I have something you want, Azak. I have something that you lost.”
She backed up from him and the web holding him loosened its grip. He dropped to the ground with both feet firmly planted in the web ground.
“Come with me, Voidmancer,” she bid him. “You will see that not only I speak the truth, but that there is possibility in all this vice.”
Azak followed her. He saw no reason not to. She led him along the giant web for an hour. All around he could see more giant web and endless darkness.
“Xiaxuhm is known among us as the most clever of Demon Kings,” she said. “His scheming is unprecedented and has gained him much territory in Gehenna. Though where he is clever, I have a more powerful trait in which I will defeat him. I have patience. I can wait for an eternity to get what I want. In this bleak nugatory, all we have is time and I have turned it into a weapon. Tell me, what is it that you think Xiaxuhm wants with you?”
“I honestly have not the faintest idea,” he said. “ How could I comprehend what motivates a Demon King?”
“Your unassuming nature is a fault,” she said. “As time goes on you will learn to question everything. Only then will you be able to fulfill the destiny that has been thrust upon you. While you may not thirst for this power as a demon would, it nevertheless has found its way to you. As becoming the one who lives between worlds, you have the ability to walk both here and in the living world. Your true self or as you mortals call it your soul.
“Xiaxuhm wants you to be his hand in the living world to execute his will. While he has the Dread Lord and other followers who can communicate with him they lack another gift which you have. That is the Aether wound that you received when you were killed. Tell me… have you noticed the feeling of someone that feels distant to you? Like you can hear their voice from afar? Or can see them off in the distance?”
“Yes…” he said as he thought about it. “I think I have.”
“This is from the Aether sword which killed you,” she explained. It has put its mark on your body and as long as both of you exists you shall be able to feel its presence no matter how far it goes. Meaning that you can find the one who wields it.”
“Sol of the Mag Mar,” Azak said, anger boiling inside him suddenly.
“Yes…” she said. “Now you are beginning to see… Though what you do not know about this Sol of the Mag Mar… he is the servant of Deus. Sheol is the realm of Devils. Deus was a Devil who made a deal with Xiaxuhm. In return for the gift he received, he was to open the gates of Gehenna for Xiaxuhm to allow him entrance into the netherworld. Instead Deus betrayed Xiaxuhm and forever sealed the gate. He then possessed the knowledge of an ancient secret to his servant Sol of the Mag Mar who exists in the living world.
“This is the secret that the ancients of your world were close to unlocking. That is how to create a rift between the dimensions. To put it simply, they figured out how to open a gate into the netherworld. Deus wants this power for himself so that he can escape into the living world.
“So what does all this have to do with me?” Azak said.
“Sol of the Mag Mar is scouring the planet for the seven Sibyls. Females who hold the secret of the ancients in their blood. When he destroyed your caravan it was to find one of these girls. The same goes for your Dread Lord when he attacked these group of nomads. Both possess dreamwalkers whose powers allows them to find the Sibyls.
“I want you to find these girls instead, Voidmancer. I want you to find them for me. I care not for the designs of Deus or Xaixuhm. I want out of this place.”
“And you think that I will help you,” he laughed.
“I know you will,” she said. No hint of doubt in her voice.
They stopped at the edge of a web. She raised her body up and pointed down. He walked to the edge and looked to what she was pointing at. He could see down into a recess of the side of another web. In this pocket of seclusin, Azak could see a woman with black hair. She held a baby at her breast who sucked softly.
“Isante…” Azak said softly as tears began to roll down his cheek. He screamed, “Isante!” She did not seem to notice him.
“She is my prisoner here,” Ibizail said. “She sees and hears only what I allow her. Right now she thinks she is still alive with you in the living world. She has no idea what has transpired. Lucky for her that I caught her in my web on her trip through the river Lethe.”
“What about… my baby?” Azak dared to ask.
“The baby was also caught here,” Ibizail explained. “She is safe though, For now. All is well in the world as long as you do what I say, Voidmancer.”
Azak wiped the tears from his face. “You will keep them safe? Like this?”
“You have my word,” Ibizail said smoothly.
“What would you have me do?”









































Chapter 6

It had gone on through the night and into the early hours of the morning. Zoe and Iree had constructed a total of three separate firewalls into Kit’s cerebral software. It consisted of refracting and adaptable coding that would be virtually impossible to break. It was a work of art and a true breakthrough, Zoe thought.
That breakthrough had come at a price though. It was now daylight and Zoe had not had a wink of sleep. She took off her neural crown and set it on the table. She picked up Kit’s hairpiece and placed it on top of his head. It connected with a click. She picked up her needle tool and used it to push the tiny button on Kit’s cerebrum. He booted up and came alive.
“Good morning,” she said as she saw him blink his eyes. “Rough night.”
“Zoe…” he said. “Zoe… I’m sorry…”
“Shhh…” she said putting a finger on his lips. “It’s not your fault.”
“I should have fought harder,” he said. “The hacker was too powerful.”
“I know. But, hell, I’m sorry too, okay? I shouldn’t have been so mean to you. Even if you weren’t yourself. I let my emotions get the best of me and it made me unable to see that you obviously had something going on.”
“Zoe…” he said as he lowered his head.
“Just promise me this,” she said and he looked up. “Promise that we won’t fight like that again.”
He smiled. “Of course.”
She stretched. “I’ve got to get ready for work. I haven’t had a wink of sleep. You feeling up to making me a pot of coffee?”
“Indeed,” Kit said standing up. “Extra cream and extra sugar?”
“You know it.”

As Zoe entered the Administrator’s office, she was glad to see Eva already sitting down. It’s amazing what a day will do for one’s perspective, she thought.
“I’ve read your v-mail,” the Administrator said. “Any idea who the hacker was that tried to kill you?”
“I was unable to track him, sir,” she said. “Whoever it is, they are good. Damn good.”
“Well you are the best cyber agent we have,” the Administrator said. “Take the precautions necessary. I trust your judgment.”
Zoe nodded. “Have you debriefed the Administrator on our findings yesterday?”
“I have,” Eva said.
“It’s not much to go on,” he said. “None of this makes any sense. I can’t make heads or tails of any of it.”
“I agree,” Zoe said. “We don’t really have any leads, either.”
“That isn’t accurate,” the Administrator said. “Your friend Lithium provided us with some very valuable information regarding one of our public officials. Magistrate Gavin of District Three seems to have been in recent contact with Lithium in regards to the Neural Net software. He was interested in software development on corporate reconnaissance for G.A.E, also known as Genetic Augment Enterprises.”
“So that was his buyer?” Zoe asked. “A magistrate? But why?”
“That’s what we need to find out. The Baron of the third district is having a ball tonight. Baron Armand is his name. I have a full briefing I am sending to your v-mail.”
“I know Baron Armand,” Zoe said. “Or at least I know of him. He served under my father in the Turf Wars. Father never approved of his methods. He was a forceful captain who shot first and asked questions later. His ability to win battles, however, made it difficult to court martial him. His prowess in politics is of equal caliber I have come to hear.”
“So be extra careful,” Administrator Walker instructed. “If this turns out to be a conspiracy of the state we need to proceed with caution. I do not want whoever is pulling the strings to catch wind of our actions.”
“Understood,” Zoe said. She looked at Eva. “So how about we go shopping?”
Eva looked confused. “Shopping? I don’t… shop…”
“Well, today you do,” Zoe responded with a smile. “We have a party to crash and we want to look our best.”

That night they arrived at the estate of Baron Armand. It was an extensive dwelling that imposed less practicality as it flaunted wealth and prestige. It was truly one of the most magnificent structures Zoe had seen in New Verum.
To even reach the courtyard, they had to cross a long bridge hanging over a canal that went around the estate. Once across the bridge, they passed under an archway with various illustrious statues looking down upon them. All were naked with wings.
“Very angelic,” Eva said. “I prefer gargoyles, however.”
Zoe smiled. As they came under the archway, the mansion came into view. Its magnificence was both awe inspiring and offensive in its luster. The Baron, it seemed, had a flare for both the dramatic and exuberance.
“I like your dress,” Eva told her. “I forgot to mention that.”
“Not too bad yourself, you fox.”
Zoe had a short red dress on. It was a lot shorter than what she would normally wear. A lot shorter. It clung to the skin tightly and accentuated her curves as never before. It also revealed much of her cleavage than what she felt comfortable with. Her hair fell down to her mid back in a layered fashion. She normally did not put herself on display like this, however, the mission demanded it. And she would play the part to the fullest, she thought.
Eva’s dress was a bit more modest. It was long and black like her hair. It had sleeves unlike the one Zoe wore. It also had lace buttons down the center and long lace flared sleeves. The dress went down just past her knees revealing the knee-high heeled boots she wore. Her black make up gave her a mysterious edge and she looked prim and demure with her hair pulled tightly into a chignon bun style.
They walked through the courtyard and to the front door where a pair of guards were checking everyone’s identification. Zoe pulled their tickets which they had acquired from Zoe’s father. He did not ask questions as to what the need of it was, instead he made a call to the Baron’s secretary asking that his daughter go in his stead. Hopefully, the change would go unnoticed.
She handed the ticket to the guard who looked at it and then at both Zoe and Eva.
“Well, you two will definitely be a fine addition to this crowd,” the man said. A burly clean cut man.
Zoe smiled flirtatiously. “Don’t make me blush.”
“It would match your dress if you did,” he said with a grin.
“He’s a charmer,” Eva said. “We may have to come visit him after the ball.”
“Be sure that you do,” he said as he opened the door and held a hand out for them to pass through.
They walked inside to see a massive ballroom with hundreds of very rich looking patrons. They were dancing, drinking, and talking like fine gentlemen and ladies. Zoe and Eva glided across the floor smiling and acknowledging the various men that stopped to look them over. They reached the other side of the room and stopped to take a look around.
“We need to find the magistrate,” Zoe said masking her lip movement as much as possible.
“We will find him,” Eva assured her. “In the meantime, what should we do?”
“Enjoy yourself,” Zoe said with a smile. She picked up a wine glass from a servant who was holding a tray of multiple glasses. He turned around in protest until he saw Zoe and then his face flushed as he bowed his head and turned to walk off.
“I really don’t get out very much for social gatherings,” Eva confessed.
“Just act natural,” Zoe assured her. “A young lady like yourself practically radiates of new money. Daddy struck his millions only recently on the Stock Exchange. Meaning that you are prime meat for the gentlemen here.”
“Oh, great,” she said.
Zoe downed the wine glass much quicker than a lady would have. “I need a refill and we need to split up. Turn on your mobile bracelet.”
They both did so. What appeared to be a gold piece of jewelry was actually a sophisticated piece of communication hardware. When their voice registered in its microphone within proximity of the mouth the other would be able to hear what was being said via a micro earpiece each of them wore.
Zoe walked across the dance floor drawing looks from every direction. Usually it would bother her, however stealth was not the mission tonight. All she had to do was find Magistrate Gavin and hopefully her charm and dash would do the rest. As she approached the beverage table, a man approached her.
Zoe immediately recognized him to be Baron Armand. He was a stone-faced man with a scar across the top of his forehead. He had very chiseled facial features and looked all the soldier she had known him to be. He wore a white suit that had embroidery decorating the collar. He looked prestigious and intimidating.
“It is a pity your father was unable to come,” he said regrettably. “Though had he not, we would not be graced by such a beautiful woman like yourself Agent Renvar.”
“Thank you, Baron Armand,” she said as he kissed her hand. “It is with deep regrets that my father must abstain from this event. He sends his condolences and to let you know that matters of the state keep him preoccupied.”
“As it does us all,” the Baron said. “Tell me, Zoe… Do you mind if I call you that?”
She nodded in approval.
“Tell me, Zoe,” he continued, “If you can say without revealing too much classification, are you any closer into solving the case of the terrorist attacks on our sovereign?”
“We make progress every day,” she told him with a nod.
“That is reassuring,” he said with a smile. “I won’t press you too much because this is a day of celebration. Did your father happen to tell you what this event is all about?”
“He did,” she said. “District three has effectively become the district with the lowest crime rate and unemployment for the fifth consecutive year. Quite a feat, I must say.”
“Indeed it is. I have been Baron for eight years now, if you can believe it. And in that time I have implemented total reform in regards to justice and economics. Rule with an iron fist and allow the market to be free as the Forebears intended it. If you do that, things begin to correct themselves. It is not without work and sacrifice, of course.”
“Well, I don’t mean to question your policies,” Zoe began, “but in regards to your first offense legislation. It not only appears to be overly harsh, I have to wonder how do you manage the prisons with such an influx of detainees.”
“It is a good question. Though, a somewhat general view on what it is that has been implemented. To answer your question, we quite simply have adopted a labor prison system. We have privatized all our prisons and turned the convicted criminals into manufacturers. They do the most dangerous and unwanted jobs in society. They do it well too, I might add. A good worker is rewarded with time reduction and better living conditions. Those who rebel face harsh consequences. As for the rest of our working class, we are able to provide them with retail and processing jobs. It is quite a revolution we have here in District Three.”
Zoe nodded. She did not want to get into a political debate. “It is indeed. I see now that what you have done is much more brilliant than what people have given you credit for.”
The baron laughed. “If you mean that incompetent, disparaging media then obviously. The Prime Director allows them too much leeway. It can’t be helped right now, I’m afraid.”
Zoe saw behind the Baron the face of the man she sought. It was Magistrate Gavin, alright. The fat and bald man was clearly as his virtual profile pictured him. He had a big mustache and his cheeks looked gibbous on his round face.
“I wish you well, Baron,” Zoe said with a curtsy. “If you would excuse me.”
“Of course,” he said as she walked away.
She approached Magistrate Gavin inconspicuously as she could. He was drinking on a tall glass of wine and she bumped into his arm as he went in for a drink. The glass fell with a crash to floor and wine went all over both of their shoes.
“Oh my god!” she cried. “I’m so sorry, sir.”
She pulled a handkerchief from out of her cleavage and bent down and started wiping the wine from the man’s shoes.
“It’s quite alright, girl,” he said. “Come, get off the dirty floor!”
She stood up and looked at him. “I wasn’t watching where I was going, I’m sorry.”
“Well, I forgive you, young lady,” he said. “Do I… know you?”
“I am afraid not,” she said pulling her hair back behind her ear. “I think I would remember meeting a Baron.”
He laughed hard and his belly rumbled. “I am no Baron, sweetheart. I am but a magistrate. A mere judge, if you will.”
“Oh,” she said timidly as she could. “Well, is there any place we could wash up?”
“Why the restroom is right over there,” he said pointing past her.
She leaned forward into his ear and said. “I mean… in private.”
“Oh?” he said shocked. “Oh…well… yes… I am sure that can be arranged.”
The Magistrate talked to one of the guards who were managing crowd control. The man eyeballed Zoe up and down and nodded at the fat man. Gavin motioned for her to come and she did so.
“This gentleman will lead us to a guest room where we can wash up,” he said with a grin.
“That is most assuring,” Zoe said sheepishly.
They were led up the arching staircase and into a hallway with many doors on either side. The man opened the door allowing Zoe and Gavin inside shutting it behind them. Gavin moved to the sofa in the middle of the room and Zoe turned around and locked the door.
“I must say, this is quite nice,” Gavin said admiring the upholstery. “Why, yes, quite nice indeed.”
Zoe turned around to face Gavin’s direction. She leaned her head forward a bit. “Is the furniture the only nice thing you see?”
“Oh, the furniture is quite bland when compared to your beauty,” he said. “What was your name again?”
“Kalyn,” she lied. “Kalyn Matix.”
“Such a lovely name. Well my name is Leonard Gavin.”
“Mind if I pour us some drinks?” she asked as she walked over to the bar. This room was furnished quite well, she admitted to herself.
“By all means, dear,” he said as he plopped his large butt on the sofa.
“What will you have?” she asked.
“Bourbon, if you would be so kind.”
She poured herself a glass of vodka and soda. Then she poured a double shot of bourbon. As she did so, she flicked her fingernail dropping the tip of it off in the drink. It fizzled quickly in it turning the concoction into an effective sleep inducing tonic. She carried the glasses over to the sofa and handed the magistrate his glass. He immediately set it on the table.
She took a seat beside him and began to sip her drink. He leaned over towards her. She looked at him and he grabbed the drink from her and set it on the table. His hand touched her thigh and started running up it as he leaned forward and began to kiss her neck.
She rolled her eyes and said, “So do magistrates make a lot of money?”
He paused his kissing. “Why, of course they do lass, you don’t have to worry about money while I am around I assure you.”
His kissing begin to run south and his face was firmly planted in her cleavage. His hand began to work its way up until it crept into her dress. He clasped his hand in between her legs.
“Mr. Leonard,” she said pushing him away. He looked at her puzzled. “Before we get to that, and we will, I want to propose a toast.” She picked up her glass and handed him his.
“Sure, my love,” he said. “What are we toasting?”
“To the start of a beautiful friendship,” she said clinking her glass to his. She took a sip and watched as he downed his. He immediately went back to her cleavage though this time pulling her top down.
“Oh…” he said looking at her exposed bosoms. “Yes… quite beautiful.”
He leaned forward onto her nipple and as he did, his eyes rolled back in his skull and he fell into a coma. With his weight crashing down on her, they both fell back onto the sofa.
“You know now that I think about it, Mr. Leonard. I am really not this kind of girl,” she said pushing his massive bulk off her. She fixed her top and held her bracelet close to her mouth.
“Eva, I have the magistrate sedated and I am going to begin my cerebral dive.”
She heard Eva’s voice in her ear. “Okay, I am still in the ballroom. I had to get away from this one guy, a most uncouth gentleman wanting to show me his sports car if I agreed to go home with him. Do you need any assistance?”
“Do you think you can get up here to watch the door?”
“I am a magi,” she responded. “Though I am sure one of the guards can be convinced to take me up to one of these rooms if I am persuasive.”
“Okay. Don’t get caught.”
Zoe took her neural crown from her purse and put it on her head. She pulled out a syringe and injected Gavin with a drug that boosted brain activity while lowering inhibitions to outside influences. She then took out another neural crown, it was modified as a slave crown. It was a device that her and some college mates had invented that allowed a user to essentially hack into one’s brain. It was a remarkable piece of technology that gained them notoriety and eventually a government censor. This type of device would be dangerous in the wrong hands so it became a regulated object only allowed to be used by specialist working under the federal intelligence agency.
Once the crown were in place, Zoe sat back on the chair. She gave the thought command to dive and she did. Though she was not in the Network but rather the load up program to the slave crown. While the network had an endless array of lights and numbers, the slave crown presented the neural workings of the individual it was meant to hack. It was a kaleidoscopic view of neurons and synapses firing and impulses traveling.
“Iree,” Zoe prompted.
“I am here, Zoe.”
“Begin neural hack under these parameters, ‘Neural Implant Chip in sequence with Genetic Augement Enterprises.’”
“Understood,: Iree said. “Loading…”
Zoe waited for a few minutes. Then Iree’s voice rang out. “I have access to the most relevant memory. Would you like to view it?”
“Yes,” Zoe said. In front of her, a bridge appeared. She walked on it, and as she did, she shot like a bullet into the various pathways carrying her to the specific memory that Iree had isolated. The process took about twenty seconds and she was there.
She stood in a room with a man and realized that she was looking from the perspective of Gavin. She looked at the other man. He was tall and pale skinned with long blonde hair. He looked familiar and she realized him to be the vampire she had fought before. Yes, it was no mistake, that was him.
“I don’t understand why you would need more neural chips,” Zoe felt herself say in Gavin’s voice.
“Because, if the Legion is to do this properly, we need more people,” the man said clearly becoming impatient.
“What exactly is so important to the cause that we have to have this research from the genetics facility?” Gavin asked.
“I told you before it is the annunaki gene that we are after. Without that we will be bombing civilians until the end of time. The annunaki gene is the final step into being able to fulfill the final step of our plan.”
“Well, what do I know,” Gavin said. “It’s the baron’s problem to decide the steps you take. I don’t think that Aeon has any more chips which is the problem. We will have to make more. That means finding someone who can actually build the damn things.”
“What do you have in mind?” the pale man asked.
“Well, I will contact Mr. Lithium, he is bound to know someone that works on this sort of thing. If I offer them enough money then surely we can get someone.”
“See to it,” the man said walking off.
Zoe thought about it. Either Lithium was not telling them everything or Gavin never delivered on his promise. More importantly, she wondered, what was this annunaki gene and what did he mean the final step to their plan.
“Iree, egress,” Zoe prompted and she was pulled out of the neural state and back into the real world.
“Zoe? Zoe do you read?” she heard Eva’s voice say.
“Zoe here, what’s up?”
“I am outside the door and looks like you might be getting company soon. They were knocking earlier and you didn’t answer so they got suspicious. I think they went to go get the key.”
“Understood,” Zoe said. She pulled off the neural crown and the slave crown putting them both in her purse. She pulled out some smelling salts and rubbed them in front of Gavin. His eyes shot open and he gasped for air.
“Oh, dear, are you okay Mr. Leonard?” Zoe asked in a frightened voice.
“What?” Gavin asked looking around blankly. “What happened?”
“Well, you passed out of course,” Zoe explained. “Maybe too much to drink. You were having trouble breathing so I was starting to worry.”
“Oh… well, no dear, I am quite alright,” he assured her. “Yes… quite alright. Now? Where were we?”
“Oh, I was just leaving,” she said standing up. “I’ll call you on the number you gave me. We will do this again soon. I had a lovely time.”
She walked off leaving Mr. Leonard Gavin with a dumbfounded expression on his face.












































Chapter 7

The dark and dank dungeon had become his home once again. As he snapped back into the living world, Azak could only ponder as to how much time had passed since he was defeated by Rook. His ribs still ached. He looked down at his Aether scars and they had also spread. It was something that he began to notice when he would take injury from the Dread Lord. When his body would regenerate, the corruption from the Aether wounds would slowly spread. It appeared since his injuries were much more serious, it spread at a faster rate.
Most of his stomach and chest was still flesh, however, though the dull pain had increased somewhat. He knew that he would still need more regeneration time and that would mean the corruption would only further spread. A price for his folly, he presumed. As to what happened when the corruption had consumed his body he could only speculate, though he was sure it would not be good.
He could not sit up due to the pain, let alone pull himself out of bed. His only choice was to lay there and contemplate his mission that he was now tasked with. The Spider Queen was very specific as to what he was to do but as far as the purpose of what his mission would accomplish was not revealed. In order to do anything, he would need help.
He thought about Lupe but he could not be sure where the acolyte’s loyalties lie. His only choice was to use Sayda. It was unclear whether she would have the will or the interest in helping him in such a dangerous task. She would have to. He thought about his plan until he slowly slipped back into his regenerative state.

Azak woke up some time later. It was impossible to tell how much time. He tried to move around and found himself much more capable. His chest was still sore but the pain was more than bearable now. He climbed out of bed and looked out the door. He could see no one. His only choice was to wait.
A few hours passed and he heard someone at the door. The lock groaned and the door opened. It was Sayda.
“Sayda!” he said.
“Voidmancer,” she replied. “I have come to see how your regeneration has progressed. It seems you are almost fully healed.”
He stood up and approached her slowly. He clasped her hands and she looked puzzled.
“Sayda… I must ask something of you… It is not easy for me… it will be even less easy for you to realize that what I speak is the truth. Will you please hear me out?”
She nodded.
“When I regenerate, my true self… my soul… leaves my body… it goes to Sheol… Do you know of this place?”
She nodded again.
“Do you know of the maidens that the Dread Lord seeks? I know what it is he plans to do with them. They are the key to unlocking the door to the netherworld. Through that he can free Xiaxuhm. This world will surely be doomed if that happens.”
“Why are you telling me this?” she asked looking into his eyes.
“They brought back a girl. One with green hair. You’ve seen her. I know you have. I need to take her out of this place. We must go somewhere far away. I need your help.”
Her head jerked away and she tried to pull her hands too though he held them tightly.
“Listen, I know I am asking too much of you. I am sorry for that. This is bigger than our own feelings. If we do not succeed then everything that we know… all will fall the same fate as the Drydalis. I now know what the Dread Lord did to this place. I know of the Temple of the Celestia. I know that it was once this Citadel. I know that your people were burned to consecrate it to Xiaxuhm. I can only imagine the horror that you have suffered since then. It is up to you to help me, Sayda. Help me save this world. There is good left in it. It is far away from here. Together, we can find it.”
She looked at him. “If I help you… you must promise to kill me if… if we are caught…”
“I promise,” he said. “Though we will succeed, Sayda. Just trust me, okay?”
“I don’t know why,” she said, “but I do trust you.”
“Do you know where they are keeping the girl?”
“I do.”
“Okay,” he said and began to pace. “We need to get the girl and then get out. Do they have any horses or transport that we can use?”
“Yes…” she said reluctantly. “We can take a wind sail. If we can get out undetected and a head start then maybe…”
“Alright,” he said. “We are going to do this. Me and you.”
They planned their escape. Azak worked the details out three times before Sayda convinced him that it was their best shot. They would go from the dungeon and head for the room where the girl was being held. After that, they would make their way to the supplies and then head to the wind sail docks. The first step is acquiring proper clothing in which to navigate the citadel.
They left the cell. It was unguarded thankfully. The Dread Lord was over confident, he could not conceive of the possibility that someone would escape. It was complete madness for one to try so it is easy to understand his reasoning.
They crept through the dank hallway.
“Wait,” Azak said. “I… have a plan.”
“What do you mean?” she asked. “We already have a plan.”
“Yes,” he said. “But now that I am here I feel different. My power has grown since my regeneration.”
“What do you mean?” she asked.
“Just wait here,” he assured her. He imagined the flame as he always did when channeling the Void and realized the shadow on the wall. He concentrated and as he did his body became the shadow. Sayda gasped.
Azak made his way up the stairs as a shade on the wall and when he reached the top he drifted into the floor and into the corridor. He came across a guard, an acolyte who was half asleep propped up on his spear. He slid behind him and regained his physical form and manifested his spear forcing it through the man’s heart. He fell into Azak’s arms as he convulsed. Azak carried him out of sight of any passerby and then turned back into his shadow form.
He found another guard not far ahead. He coasted onto the ceiling and when he was directly above the man, he manifested. With his spear in hand, he thrust it into the back of the man’s neck. After hiding the body, he went back for Sayda. They made their way back up and changed into the acolyte’s clothing.
She led him into the east wing of the Citadel where his old room was. They climbed up a circular staircase she had assured him was rarely traveled at this time of night. After that, they went forward into the grand hallway. It was a different part of the wing from where Azak had stayed, much more luxurious and well kept. A Rune Knight passed by without paying much attention to them.
“Her room is at the end of this hall,” she said as they came across a new corridor. “It will be guarded by two Rune Knights…”
“Leave them to me,” he said. It was a mystery how they would deal with this part until now. His powers were becoming more clear to him as he moved around. He did not understand how the discovery process worked, but he imagined it was no different than a newborn buffalo coming into the world with knowledge of how to walk. He had become the antithesis of nature.
He transformed into shadow and made his way into the hallway. He spotted the Rune Knights and crept in closer. He stopped a ways back from them and manifested himself. They spotted him and looked at him curiously as if their eyes deceived them. He used the moment to form his sling and let fly a stone.
The stone hit one of the knights in the forehead and exploded in a silent and deadly fashion. The purple explosion sprayed into the other knight’s face blinding him while the one he had struck fell over in a decapitated mess. Azak charged forward and shoved his spear directly into the surviving knight’s armor. The first blow hit him and dissolved the thick plate mail in an acidic onslaught. He cried out briefly as the purple acid burned the armor and his chest, but the scream was cut short as Azak had driven his second attack into the knight’s heart.
He went back for Sayda and as they approached the door, she looked at the Rune Knights with disbelief. She said nothing, however. Azak pulled the key ring from the first knight’s belt he had fell. He unlocked the big wooden door and went in.
The room was dimly lit though it was fairly large. It had little in the way of furnishings. At the bed, he saw the green haired girl sleeping. She was maybe ten years old, by the looks of her.
“Let me wake her,” Sayda said. She shook the girl gently. The girl’s green eyes slowly opened blinking.
“Ma?” she asked.
“No, my dear,” Sayda said. “We are here to take you out of this place. We need you to come with us and stay quiet.”
“Are you an angel?” she asked.
“No, dear. Please, come with us.”
The girl stood up and did as she was told. She grabbed Sayda’s hand tightly. Sayda looked at Azak and nodded.
They made their way from the east wing taking another route from the way they had come. This floor did not have many occupants, at least not that Azak could see.
They came upon another stair well. They began to make their way down the long and dark stairway.
“Don’t be scared,” Sayda assured the girl.
“I won’t be,” she said.
“There are two guards at the entrance of this floor,” Sayda said grabbing Azak’s arm. He nodded.
He changed into his shadowform and made his way out. As Sayda had claimed, there were two guards. He manifested with spear in hand and with a quick succession of strikes, stabbed the first in the throat and the second through his gut up into his heart, the acidic spear effectively destroying the internal organs it came into contact with. He pulled the guards into the dark stairway and under the bottom rows of stairs. He motioned for the girls to come and they did so.
“You’re the shadowman,” the girl said to Azak. “I dreamed about you.”
Azak ignored the comment. “You need to stay quiet,” he said.
They worked their way down another set of winding hallways. There was not much in the way of guards. The few they saw they managed to sneak past with relative ease.
“Their is a supply cache just beyond that door,” she said. Azak transformed and slipped under the door. There were no guards inside it so he manifested and unlocked the door from the inside.
They gathered as much food and water as they could carry. They gave the little girl a blanket to carry and she took it looking proud of herself as if she was contributing to their efforts to escape.
“The docks are not far,” Sayda told him.
She led them through a half a dozen more hallways. The scale of the Citadel was that of a labyrinth, Azak thought. They exited a door and found themselves inside a massive cave. Azak could see the wind sails from where he was. He did a quick survey of the wooden bridges that led down to them. He spotted three guards in various positions scattered throughout.
“Wait here,” he told them. In similar fashion as before, he manifested his shadowform and made his way through to the individual guards. He would take his true form long enough to kill one and then hurried to the next. In less than a few minutes they were all dead.
They quickly made their way onto one of the wind sails. The boats were square like platforms that held parallel wings and a primitive form of anti gravity devices which made the platform float. On the platform was a small opening in which one could go down to the lower deck. Just behind the opening was the massive sail that connected to both flotation devices. In the front of the platform was a wheel in which to steer.
They put their supplies in the lower deck and told the girl to stay put. They went back up onto the platform.
“So do you have any idea how to fly this thing?” Azak asked her.
She pulled a lever near the sail and the flotation devices hummed and the vessel began to hover.
“These crafts were built by my people,” she said. She pulled a rope connected to the center mass and the sail began to spread open like a bird with wings. “There is no wind in here so we will have to run the motor until we are outside.”
She tapped her foot on a piece of device embedded into the floor near the wheel and the craft began to move forward. She put more pressure on the pedal as they cleared the docks and they gained speed heading out of the cave and out into the night.
Sayda pulled another lever as they cleared the cave. The top mast extended more than double in length and as it did so, the horizontal sails sprung open carrying the vessel forward. Their speed increased as they got further away from the cave out into the open. Azak turned to see the Citadel, its ominous presence looking down on them.
“It won’t be long until they notice we are gone,” Sayda said. “There will be a patrol heading for the docks soon.”
“Well, let’s try to put as much distance between us and them as we can,” Azak said. He looked over to the little girl. She had the blanket wrapped around her, her green eyes looking up at Azak. “Don’t be scared. I will protect you.”
“I’m not scared,” she said.
“What is your name?”
“Aybel,” she said. “And yours?”
“Azak, and this here is Sayda.”
“Thank you, for saving me from the bad men,” she said. “They killed everyone in the caravan. They were nice people. They saved me when I was a baby.”
“Saved you how?” Azak asked.
“My parents were dead and so were the rest of my tribe, from a pestilence. That is what they say.”
Azak nodded. He looked past her. “We’ve got company,” he said to Sayda. “Can we go any faster?” There were four wind sails gaining on them in the distance.
Sayda turned the wheel hard to port and the sails caught the wind fully. They picked up speed. Minutes passed and he could see the other vessels slowly gaining on them.
“Damn,” he said. “We won’t be able to outrun them forever.”
“What are we going to do?” Sayda asked calmly as she tightly gripped the wheel.
“The only thing we can do,” Azak said. “Fight.”
“Okay, this vessel has no weapons,” she said.
“I will destroy their ships. When I do come back for me.”
She nodded.
Azak looked at Aybel. “Stay brave,” he said. “I’ll be back soon.”
He looked at the closest wind sail and gauged the distance in his mind. What he thought about doing was crazy but just crazy enough that it might work. He sprinted to the back of the ship and jumped in the air. As he came close to the ground he transformed into shadow and began to swim on the desert ground like a predator pouncing its prey. He moved with the speed of a falcon, pushing his powers to the limit.
The wind sail charged towards him, unknowingly as it might be, and as it came near him his form clung to the bow of the ship racing upwards. He came up furiously and as he reached the railing, he manifested his true form and the momentum carried him skyward. He came down, spear in his hand, the acolyte piloting the vessel had no time to react and Azak skewered his face.
Two more acolytes were on board and saw what happened, though it took them a moment to process what had occurred. Azak charged the closest one, twirling his spear and then his body. As he came around, he extended the spear out and as the acolyte tried to parry with his own spear, he took a blow to the leg. On contact, the spear reacted like acid melting the man’s leg off. Azak quickly finished him off with a blow to the chest.
The other man charged forward quickly hoping to impale Azak while his back was turned. Instead Azak took to the shadows again and darted under and behind the man and came up with a kick to the back. The man flew over the side of the railing landing face first into the desert floor with a crack of his neck.
Azak sprinted towards the helm of the ship and grabbed the wheel. There was another wind sail parallel to the right of him. He turned the vessel hard to starboard. The other acolytes who had witnessed Azak’s slaughter caught on to his intentions and began screaming frantically at their own pilot. By the time he figured out what was happening it was too late and the ships collided into each other.
The bow of Azak’s ship went up and over the other’s railings and crushed two of the men. The portside crashed into their top deck and the weight of it drove both ships crashing down into the desert. As metal and wood crushed everything in on itself, Azak took to the shadows again.
He sped to the next closest ship. His trajectory had been a bit off thanks to the momentum of being flung from the wreckage and he pushed himself to take his powers further. He caught up with the fleeting craft and in a similar method, he went right up onto the railing of the ship. Instead of going over, however, he merely grabbed onto it. He began to drive his spear into the anti-gravity device below him. The acidic spear made quick work of it and the boat began to spin out of control.
Azak abandoned ship and a few moments later, it flipped over crushing everyone on board. While in shadow form he moved ahead of the remaining ship. His speed was now more than double that of the wind sail and he pushed forward. After he gained enough distance, he manifested into his true form. The wind sail was heading directly at him.
He formed his sling and began to spin it over his head and he waited a few moments before hurling one of his shadow stones at it. It hit the front of the ship and exploded along with the pilot. The remaining acolytes watched helplessly as the man’s body parts flew in every direction. Azak had already let loose two more stones and one exploded on the deck killing one of the men. The other hit at the starboard side and it collapsed in on itself.
Azak let fly three more stones as the vessel continued screaming towards him, more sliding across the ground than hovering. By the time it reached him, it was little more than wreckage. He turned to see the wind sail in which Sayda and Aybel were riding in to make a hard turn back in his direction, apparently having seen the carnage that had ensued.


















Chapter 8

It was a busy day at the Agency Headquarters, and Zoe was feeling tired. She had finally gotten a few hours of sleep but the case was taking its toll on her. The clues were coming slowly like some lethargic snail that was intent on leading her to insanity. The pieces that she had did not make sense. They did not connect in the typical fashion that terror crimes do. Not once had the Legion made any sort of political demands. From what they could piece together, their whole mission was to just cause slaughter and panic.
“You look like shit, Zoe,” Vance told her as he looked up from his chair. He had dark brown skin and a bit of an afro that he hardly took the time to manage. His beard was also equally disheveled. He was in charge of the cyberspace defense team. A group of elite hackers and programmers that numbered around thirty. He was not as good a hacker as Zoe, but his skills on computer architecture and programming made him just as formidable.
“Thanks,” she said. “I feel like shit if that helps my case.”
“When is the last time you had a day off?” he asked as he lit a cigarette.
“I think I am on my twelfth week.”
“Hot damn,” he said. “I always knew you were hardcore, Zoe. You are going to get old before your time. Believe me, I know. I am already getting gray hairs.”
“I just want to make some real progress on this case,” she admitted. “It does nothing for me to sit on my ass.”
“Don’t be so hard on yourself. You have made real headway the past few weeks. We are still analyzing the slave crown data you brought back. Between that and the information dump that Lithium has provided us, we will have leads coming out the ass in no time. You don’t do anyone any good by wearing yourself down like this.”
“Have you managed to find anything else on the Net in regards to the Legion recruiting method?”
“Shit,” he said. He inhaled his cigarette and exhaled. “I can’t make heads or tails of it. Every now and again we will get a hot tip of a lobby or forum where one might be happening. For all the good it does us to look into it. People talk though. Say weird shit like… the guy they knew just up and left one day with no word. Always the same story of some guy spouting some shit about ‘Veritas Animus’. Saying the establishment and the status quo are gearing up for the end times and that it is the will of the people that will save humanity. Just a bunch of vague conspiracy theory that we haven’t been able to pick apart yet. I got my people on it though there is no real context to go by other than the pseudo history that has only recently cropped up on the Net.”
“’Veritas Animus’,”she said, half to herself.
“It means literally the truth in the soul, or the truth in the most absolute sense. I guess in this context with the political sense. There is a lot of religious undertone. Though most of it is just babble. Something about Deus being caught up in a battle with the One God. Also, that hell is in some sort of civil war between Gehenna and Sheol.”
“I wonder if there is any connection to the Church of the Second Cataclysm?”
“Not that we have been able to pinpoint. So far it seems to be pulling things from different religions as people see the need to connect dots. With the neural chips these recruiters are obviously using, the normal residue people leave behind on the Net are not there. It is like chasing after ghosts.”
“Sooner or later one of them will slip up,” she said as she put a hand on his shoulder.
“Look, Zoe, take a day off. I got my people on this. Just give it some time and come in with a fresh eye. I am sure that we will get to the bottom of this thing.”
She smiled. “Damn. A day off… whatever would I do?”
“Take that cute partner of yours out for a drink. Unwind a little. The chatter is you have been pretty hard on breaking her in. Might help to just show her the human side of you.”
“So now you are guilt tripping me.”
“Whatever works. Do it for me. Put in a good word if you know what I mean.”

Zoe reluctantly decided that Vance had a point. She had overworked herself and it was showing in her work. He even talked her into taking Eva out for some beers. She seemed surprised when Zoe offered but quickly accepted the offer.
The bar they were meeting at was called the Red Light. It was a cozy little spot in the second District where Zoe used to go to often, back in her college years. There were not really a lot of brawls or loud mouths to interrupt someone wanting a place to unwind.
She parked her sport bike out front and walked in. She felt loose in her blue jeans and t-shirt and the pony tail she wore felt listless which fit her mood perfectly. A few heads turned as she entered, but she did not get the stares that she was used to especially as of late while donning her federal uniform. Eva was sitting at the bar and Zoe approached and took a seat beside her.
“Hey partner,” Eva said.
“Hey, long time no see,” Zoe quipped. She looked at the bartender. “Linwood beer, please.”
“You seem less tense than usual,” Eva said smiling. “I like it.”
“Well, don’t get used to it. I have an image to keep.” The bartender handed her the beer which she took a big gulp. She did not drink beer often but it still hit the spot as she swallowed.
“I won’t tell anyone.”
“What about you? We have never really talked about what you do outside of work. Is everything okay with you?”
“Yeah, sure,” Eva said not really looking comfortable with the sudden subject. “I mainly recluse in my apartment. Read and stuff. I don’t do the Net and I rarely go out. It took me a while to even find what to wear here. All my clothes are black and I didn’t want to sour the mood. I bought these blue jeans on the way over honestly and changed them in the car.”
Zoe managed a laugh. “You got all dressed up for me? You shouldn’t have.”
“I know how you are with image. Plus, it’s nice. I feel normal. As strange as that sounds.”
“Then you are managing better than me. I might reach that point after a few more beers.”
“Well, you are natural in any situation,” Eva told her. “And I’m not kissing your ass. You’re a fucking predator.”
“Thank you,” Zoe said, half amused. “You have been handling yourself pretty good too. Though, I must ask… why federal intelligence? As a warlock level magi, you could work for a mega-corporation making bank. This type of life style is usually reserved for the more dutiful.”
“You mean you don’t see many magi in this line of work? It’s simple really… This is where I want to be. When I was sent to the Mage Consortium as a girl, I knew that I wanted to make a difference in the city. A real difference. Most of my friends, if you can call them that, went on to work at factories or plants utilizing their special abilities to become valuable assets to society. It is all just fluff though. I don’t want my powers to be exploited by the rich. I want to catch the bad guys. As lame as that sounds. I was already studying at the Military Academy when the Legion began their rampage. After that I knew that I wanted to be on the team that would take them down.”
“And here we are,” Zoe said finishing her beer. She motioned to the bar tender to get her another one. He promptly did so.
“What about you?” Eva asked. “Why did you join up?”
“My family was military,” Zoe told her. “My father is the General. My mother was the liaison officer for the military and mega-corporations. Her job was to maintain the supply lines during the Turf Wars keeping the military armed and well fed.”
“I wasn’t born then,” Eva confessed.
“The gangs had established a treaty with the military when I was eight years old,” Zoe explained. “Before that happened, I was with my mother and she had just picked me up from ballet school. If you can believe that I used to do girly things like that. We had just reached our apartment, a temporary housing arrangement my mother had made in order to be close to the Medical Mutual Service Foundation, a key corporation that provided supplies to the troops. As we entered the building there was a gang attack. We hid in the hallway and it wasn’t long until the military had arrived. Those last days were especially brutal and the military was pulling out all the stops. The shock and awe campaign they ran left mass collateral damage in their wake. We were no exception. The building we were in collapsed. We later found out that it was due to a new type of thermobaric weapon being deployed in order to flush out the gangs who would use civilians as shields. The theory at the time was that while civilian lives would be lost, it would keep the scope of the casualties limited to those already in the area of effect. By the time we were pulled from the wreckage two days later, my mother was dead and I was severely dehydrated and close to death.”
“Goddamn,” Eva whispered.
“I would say it is a sense of revenge of my mother’s death that keeps me doing what I do,” Zoe said. “I feel nothing though. There was a time where I hated the gangs. Hell, I even hated the military. There reached a point when it stopped mattering. I just knew that I was beyond the normal citizen. I feel alive. The city might be dying around me but in the end I survived. I exist as a duty to the ideal that people will go on. New Verum, for all its flaws, is a place of hope and aspires to be more than that which corrupts it. I believe in it in that sense, I suppose.”
“Thank you for sharing that…” Eva said finally.
“Don’t go getting all sentimental now, chick.”
“Who me? I am just glad we are finally breaking the ice.”
“You don’t have to worry about me,” Zoe told her. “It’s true that I prefer working alone. Hell, I like being alone. People tend to slow me down. That being said, you’re alright.”
“You don’t have to sweet talk me, you know.”
“How about we get out of here.”
Zoe took her to the apartment, despite her better judgment. She did not like letting people into her sanctuary. There were some parts of herself she wanted to remain secret. She knew that if she needed to trust Eva, this was a good way to do that. There was that part of her that was starting to like her as well.
They walked in and Kit’s head poked from around the corner from the living room.
“Oh, hello Zozo,” he said. “I am busy rearranging the furniture. I hope you don’t mind.”
“Kit, there is someone I would like you to meet,” she told him.
“Oh?” Kit said as he approached them. “We rarely have guests here. This is truly an occasion.”
“This is Eva,” Zoe said. “Eva… meet Kit, my android and friend.”
“Nice to meet you, Miss Eva,” Kit said with a bow.
“Right back at ya,” Eva said smiling.
“Well, if I had some fair warning that we would have company I would have cooked,” Kit admitted. “That being said, if you don’t mind waiting a bit, I can see what I can whip up in the kitchen.”
“Sure, I’m famished,” Eva said.
“Did you move the liquor cabinet, Kit?” Zoe asked him as she went into the living room.
“I did, would you like me to get you some drinks?” he asked.
“No, that’s okay. We can manage it.”
Zoe grabbed some glasses and made her self a vodka soda. “Any particular drink you want?”
“Rum and ice, please,” Eva said.
“You want something to mix it with?”
“No, I like it like this.”
Zoe took her spot on the couch. She kicked off her shoes and propped her feet up on the table.
“Relax a bit,” she told Eva. “House rules.”
Eva took a spot beside Zoe. “I don’t drink often. I am already buzzing pretty good. This may set me over the edge.”
“Well, you can sleep here on the couch. I don’t mind.”
“Thanks. And thanks for tonight. It’s cool that we are finally getting to know each other.”
“Well, we can’t stay strangers if we are to work as a team,” Zoe said. She was also starting to buzz. She had put too much vodka in this soda.
“I know we are partners and all…” Eva began, “But… well… I notice how you look at me… and I just want to say that if we were to make something of that… I would be okay with it.”
Zoe paused before she responded. She was not expecting this. “Eva… If I have led you to think that I am attracted to you… Well… I am sorry for that…”
“So you don’t like me?” Eva asked.
“I didn’t say that,” Zoe said. “We are partners. I don’t get romantically involved when my work is involved. Do you understand?”
“So, when the case is over?”
“We will see,” Zoe told her. “Anything is possible. I don’t want you to jump the gun on anything. If this becomes a distraction then…”
At that instant the video projector kicked on. It was an emergency alert broadcast. Zoe had the machine set to automatically project any emergency alert that was beyond a test. A man in a studio appeared on the screen.
“We are here live, from the BMP headquarters, to bring you this live report. From what we have gathered so far, it seems that the terrorist group known as the Legion has taken over the New Verum Super Dome in the midst of the Hover Ball game. We take you now live to the scene.”
“Shit…” Zoe said.
The image appeared on screen was definitely inside the dome. In the middle of the field, it looked as if the team players were running off the field. The camera was focused on a man with long red hair and a long beard wearing a trench coat. He had an assault rifle and was firing bursts up into the air. He finally turned to look at the camera.
Zoe grabbed her neural crown and put it on.
‘Iree, record this broadcast and patch me into the Super Dome Mainframe,’ Zoe said.
Iree did so and Zoe navigated her way into the camera systems. She did a quick sweep of the crowd and she could see men with assault rifles spaced throughout the stands. She zoomed in on the man in the field who began to speak. His voice rang through the comm systems. Obviously he was also hacking the system.
‘Run a trace on that man’s cyber-link,’ she told Iree.
“New Verum is soon to be two hundred years old,” the man’s voice rang. “For two hundred years you people have invaded what was once the great city of Morincium. You have corrupted the streets with disease and poverty. You do not belong here. We, the Legion, have declared war. For the past year, we have probed the defenses of this city. None of you are safe. This saturation of perversion ends now. It is time that all invaders know the truth. The hour of purification is upon us. We are releasing the techno virus known as Lentumortis. It will be confined to this arena.”
Shouts of panic began to erupt throughout the arena and the men with assault rifles began to fire in the air to calm the sudden outburst. The man continued, “It will take the virus a total of one month to kill off the people here in this stadium. If the inhabitants of New Verum have cleared out by that point then we will release the antidote formula. The lives of these people are in your hands leaders of New Verum.”
At that instant the man exploded, as did each of the men who were keeping the crowd at bay. The explosions consisted of a green smoke which spread throughout the stadium. The technovirus, Zoe thought.
She took off the neural crown. The man in the studio spoke again.
“There are two hundred thousand souls currently occupying the Super Dome,” the man said softly. “All of which are now infected…”
“Well…” Zoe said with a clenched fist, “So much for my day off…”






Chapter 9

The wind sail skimmed across the Arid Plains at a surprising speed. Azak was sure they had a good lead on the Necrofiends that were pursuing them, but the more distance they could put between them the better. He let Sayda do the driving, not only because she knew what she was doing, but because she seemed to immensely enjoy it. She did not smile, but Azak sensed a peace about her he had not felt before.
“Where will we go?” Aybel asked him, her green hair fluttering in the wind.
“To a great city far away. It is still a long ways to go. Once we are there, it is not likely that the Necrofiends will follow us.”
“I have never been to a city,” she said. “My papa used to tell me stories of them though. That they have flying boats and tents made of stone touching the sky. He said there are more people than there are stars in the sky.”
“Some of that may be true,” Azak said. “The truth is I have never been to a city either. I’ve been to a settlement now and again but those can hardly count as cities.”
“Will you and Sayda be my parents now?” she asked.
“No…” Azak said. “But we will watch over and protect you.”
She nodded. “Sayda is really pretty. Don’t you think so?”
“She is.”
“When I was living in the caravan, all the boys would make fun of me. Because of my hair. I looked different from all the other girls.”
“It sounds like they were jealous.”
“They weren’t. I don’t blame them. I am an enigma. That’s what the elders would say. The child of Id.”
“Child of Id?” Azak asked.
“Yes, it is their legend. The children of Id would find the way to the other world. That is what the Necrofiends wanted me for. I don’t know how to find another world. And if I did… I would never tell them.”
“Good girl,” Azak smiled. He walked over to Sayda. “We need to find a place to stop. A sandstorm will be on us soon. Take us in between those cliffs and that should give us some cover.”
She turned the wheel towards the right and the windsail drifted towards the cliffs. “I want to thank you,” she said.
“Thank me?”
“Yes. You gave me the courage to leave that odious life behind. I feel a great sorrow for the ones I left behind yet…”
“I should be thanking you,” Azak told her. “Without you helping me, this would have been a real short trip. You are my hero.”
She smiled. It was not a big smile but for her it seemed as if a veil had been lifted from her face. She had always seemed so pitiful before, Azak thought. Such a beautiful person, this Drydalis, and yet completely broken. Or at least he thought of her. It turns out that even after one hundred years of living in that hell there was still some spark of life in her. All it needed was a bit of fuel to turn it into a wildfire. And now here they are, on the run from the Dread Lord into the great unknown.
They sailed into the canyon and Sayda pulled two levers which closed all the sails except the foresail. Their speed decreased to a slow stride as the cliff walls began to envelope the ship. When they were all but covered by the rock face, she brought the ship to a halt.
“I found a map in the deck below,” Azak said. “We should plot our course.”
“Agreed,” said Sayda. “We used half of our biofuel when we changed course during the chase. Depending on where we are going we may need more.”
They went below deck. Azak pulled the map off the shelf and spread it open on the table.
“Now, if I am reading this right, we should be somewhere around this area,” Azak said pointing to a spot that was south east of the Bleaklands.
“Let me see,” Sayda said. She looked at it closely as if she was dissecting some hidden information that Azak could not make out. “Yes, we are here to be precise.” She pointed at a specific point on the map in the vicinity Azak had predicted. He did not question her.
“Okay,” he said. “We need to go here.” He pointed to the east at a settlement that sat on the ocean front.
“Armagetown,” Sayda said as she read the name. “What will we find there?”
“If we are lucky… we will find sailors. The Argonauts to be specific. There we will book passage that will take us to our destination.”
“These Argonauts will just accept us onto their vessel?” Sayda asked puzzled.
“Not exactly,” Azak said. “I have a plan for that.” He pointed at an area on the map between them and Armagetown. “If you look here, we have to pass over the ashlands. We passed through here in our caravan ten years ago. These were good hunting grounds for karkadann. If we can find one then I can kill it. The horn has extremely valuable medicinal qualities.”
“Alright…” Sayda said. “I assume killing one would be easy for you. Do you think you can find one?”
“That is the trick. But, yes, I can do it.”
“Okay. Tomorrow, we will head to these ashlands. Just let me memorize the calculations.”
“Do we have to kill it?” Aybel asked.
Azak turned to her. “Yes, I am afraid so.”
“I don’t like killing,” she replied. “Even the bad men. I know they deserve it. But I don’t like it.”
“It is a part of life. All things die. This karkadann will be of much use to us.”
“Well, it will go to heaven right?” she asked.
Azak winced. “There is no heaven,” he said hesitantly.
“There is. My mother and father went there. And so did my godparents.”
Azak began to reply but Sayda touched his arm. He looked at her and could see in her eyes that she did not want him to speak any more of it. He felt an anger inside him but he held his tongue.
“Animals return to the planet when they die,” Sayda explained. “Their spirit is recycled so that the planet can heal and begin life anew.”
Aybel nodded seeming satisfied with the answer. Azak ignored the discussion. Normally he would not find discussing the afterlife with a child to be an issue of emotion. This was before he experienced the afterlife first hand. His wife and child exist there now, hanging on by a thread of mercy from some demon queen. If they are to remain in a peaceful existence in that hell, Azak must complete the task she bid him.
“Where will we go?” Sayda asked. Azak looked at her puzzled. “Once we book passage. Is there a place you have in mind that we go?”
“Yes. A city called New Verum. It is the safest place to take the child. She will be safe there.”
“Speaking of which, you should try to get some rest, Aybel,” Sayda said gently. She pulled off a blanket from the shelf and formed a pallet for Aybel to lay on.
“Okay,” Aybel said reluctantly. “Will you sleep beside me tonight?”
“Yes,” Sayda said. “In a bit.”
Azak walked above deck and Sayda followed him.
“What do you know of this New Verum?” she asked him.
“Not much,” he admitted. “I know there are magus there who know a bit about her condition. Ones that don’t work for Xiaxuhm.”
“Should I even ask how you know all of this?”
“I would rather you didn’t. Not now anyways. Everything is happening so fast and we need to focus on what is in front of us.”
“Well, I do know that the child has some kind of magical powers,” Sayda told him. “The Dread Lord spoke of it when I was there… He beckoned me to come to his chambers to report on you every morning. One morning I could hear him discussing the child while he was in a trance. While he… talked to Xiaxuhm.”
“She said she was a Child of Id, whatever that is.”
“From what I could make out, it is a rare form of magic. Something that appears every hundred years or more. Meaning she is probably the only one of her kind. There is no telling who her real parents are.”
“The Dread Lord will hound us every step of the way,” Azak said. “Once we reach New Verum, I am confident it is outside his reach. Until then we have to remain vigilant.”
She touched his hand. “I know that you are quick to fight. And that you cannot die. However, you have to remain uninjured for us. If you regenerate, then you cannot protect us.”
He nodded. She was right, of course. His powers were at a level now that he had an advantage over even a Rune Knight. It would be useless against the Dread Lord but as long as they stayed ahead of him, then the power he had now should be sufficient.
“I know that the Dread Lord took something from you,” she said. “Something that cannot be replaced. That is his way. He did the same thing to me and my kin.”
“As surprising as it is, it was not the Dread Lord who wronged me. At least not in the sense that has led me to what I am now. It was an elfen man named Sol of the Mag Mar. He looked similar to you though he was not a Drydalis. His skin was pale and he had blue hair with colorless eyes.”
“A dark elf,” she said. “The Dokkalfar. They live deep in the underbelly of the planet. The Drydalis had knew of them in legends. It is strange that he would have come to the surface… do you know what would bring him?”
“Yes,” Azak said. “He wants Aybel. For the same reason the Dread Lord does. Though Sol works for a different god… one called Deus. If you can keep them all straight.”
“Deus is no god. He is a devil.”
Azak looked puzzled. “What do you mean?”
“There is a civil war between the devils and the celestials. Deus leads the devils. Xiaxuhm remains trapped in Gehenna… the abode of the wicked. Or to call them by their proper name… the demons.”
“Well… shit…” Azak said. “I don’t know if what you say is true… Or even what to make of it… Hell…”
“It’s okay,” she said touching his chest. “Don’t think about it right now. Like you said, focus on what is in front of us.”
He touched her hand. It was soft and warm. He could feel his own coldness. The price of undeath, he figured.
“This is… difficult for me,” he said.
“I understand.” She touched his cheek. Her warm hands made chills run down his spine. “You are also the only one of your kind, Azak. That is why the Dread Lord wanted you. The Voidmancer, he would tell me. He would talk of you like you were some new toy that he wanted to show the world.”
Azak did not respond. He just stood there letting her hands rub his cheek.
“One day we will have to return,” she said. He looked at her suprised. “When we do, you will defeat him. I want to be the one to kill him.”
He nodded. She went below deck and he stood outside waiting and watching. He did not require sleep and so his duty would be to watch over these two souls. In doing that, maybe the two souls that were in another world would remain safe and secure. If he believed in a god, he would have prayed they do.

























Chapter 10

The room was similar to the Forum, in a fashion. There was a round table and a group of elite men and women sitting around it with the Prime Director at the head. Instead of Barons occupying the seats, various advisers that the Director appointed occupied the space.
There were actually windows in this room, Zoe thought with a relief. The Forum felt way to closed, like the room was pressing down on her, trying to crush her will.
General Martuk Renvar stood up from his place beside the Director. “Panel. I would like to introduce you to my daughter, Miss Zoe Renvar. She is a special agent at the Federal Intelligence Agency. The Director has appointed her to this council as our expert counter terrorism liaison.”
Zoe nodded as she moved to the unoccupied seat at the far side of the table. She sat down as gracefully as she could. She could feel their stares and it was obvious they were not happy about the circumstance that had triggered her appointment. More than likely, most of them blamed the FIA for the Legion’s attack.
“I have called this meeting so that this Panel can pull together its resources for the city in the midst of this catastrophe,” Prime Director Baxter said. “Please update the Panel on the situation of the Super Dome.”
“We have the Super Dome under quarantine, Mr. Director,” said a woman a few seats to the left of Zoe. She had long black hair and a tan skin tone. She wore small framed glasses and a white lab coat. “The Health and Human Services Bureau is working double shifts trying to maintain the quarantine while simultaneously trying to study this new technovirus. So far, our studies have been inconclusive at best.”
“Well, perhaps we at the Pharmaceutical Research Conglomerate can assist the government in this,” a man said. He had long brown hair and a mustache. His attire was a very nice business suit. “We have made progress on creating vaccines for a number of technoviruses. I am sure if we were to pool our resources in this endeavor, then it would drastically increase the success rate of finding a cure.”
“I will see you at the end of this meeting so that we may do so,” the woman said. “With the authorization of the Director, of course.”
“Yes, of course,” Director Baxter said. “Now, what of the military? How are we faring in the policing of the city? If I read the numbers correctly, we are straining to keep the Super Dome area warden off while maintaining our duty to protect and serve the rest of the districts.”
“It is true we are stretched thin,” General Renvar said. “We are managing it for the time being. As for a prolonged period, it is hard to estimate. The gangs may decide to take advantage of our momentary weakness and exploit it. If that happens we could be facing a serious uprising. If we were to consider an external threat then…”
“Yes, yes, yes!” the Director said waving his hand. “Is there any way we can conscript new soldiers? Train them as auxiliary?”
“Not at this time,” the general said. “For that kind of transition I would need to pull men off the street to oversee the recruitment phase. Which we cannot afford.”
“What about androids?” the director asked as he looked to a woman with long brown hair and delicate features.
“You know that my father built Automaton Solutions with the strict mandate of having no androids that we produce be used as a military or policing unit. It is a mandate which I have and intend to keep. I am sorry, Mr. Director. It is simply out of the question.”
“We maybe able to help,” said a man beside her. He was an older man who dressed similar to a baron. He had formal attire and wore a white hat. “We at Omegacorp Robotics have no such qualm in making military grade hardware. We have models ready to ship now that are specifically designed for urban pacification.”
“How much would it cost the city?” the director asked.
“It is an extensive project,” the man in the white hat said. “Very expensive, but given the circumstance, we will allow the government to purchase them via a long term loan. We can work out the details and the director himself can view our production floor so as to see exactly what this city will get for its hard earned taxes. We are very proud of the new Bio-Armored Combat Units. That BACUs are the company’s finest achievement and it would serve both of our interests to establish negotiations that are both well thought out and planned.”
“Very well,” the Director said. “And now… Ms. Renvar, if you would, please tell us what you can about the Legion and what the FIA is doing to eliminate this threat once and for all.”
“Most of what we know is classified,” Zoe said reluctantly. “What I can say is that, the Legion is operating from within the city and they are well funded. They are also far reaching. Meaning they have help from unlikely sources. While it is too early to pinpoint these collaborators, I will say that the corruption is extensive. It is imperative that any information, no matter how irrelevant it may seem, if it is out of place, be reported to authorities. We have set up various channels to be able to filter out what is important. Failure to do so will not only cost lives, it can put the future of your companies in jeopardy.”
“I think we are all well aware of the gravity of this situation,” the man in the white hat said. “Are you implying that one of our companies is funding these terrorists?”
“I am saying that we are not ruling anything out,” Zoe told him. “From the government, to the corporations, to the gangs, and even private citizens. Everything is being checked out. There have been too many lives lost already from organizations sweeping things under the rug in order to save face. Those days are over. I don’t intend to make idle threats, I only want to be understood. The Super Dome is the Legion’s incitement mechanism. Meaning they have declared total war on this city and will not stop its destructive path until they get what they want. We now know what that is. We still have no motive, whatsoever. That leaves way too many unanswered questions. What we are all left with is an impossible situation that we are tasked with mending. I have no doubt we will catch these radicals. Until then, everyone is a suspect.”
“Thank you, Miss Renvar,” the director said. She could not tell if he was upset with her or just tired. She did not care either way. This whole case had gotten out of control and she did not like things not making sense.

Back at the FIA headquarters, Zoe sat in her office thinking about her next move. There was a knock at the door.
“Come in,”she said. Eva walked in.
“You wanted to see me?” she asked.
“Yes,” Zoe said. “We need to figure out our next move.”
“What did you have in mind?”
“I have a special assignment for you. It will be a stand alone. Hopefully not dangerous but we cannot afford to let our guard down. Are you up for it?”
“Of course,” Eva said with a nod.
“Okay. You are to go to Baron Leland’s estate. I want you to show him this,” she handed Eva a holorecording drive. “Listen closely to what I have to say…”

With Eva gone, Zoe went to the Cyberspace Defense Department which was not far from her office.
“It’s about time you got here,” Vance said as she walked in. “Come with me.”
They went into the solitary neural center which was a long room full of computer screens that allowed one to view other people’s view of the Network. It also consisted of many lay down chairs so that people could dive for long periods of time.
“Okay,” Vance said. “So we ran scans on every one of the terrorists that blew themselves up at the Super Dome. All were ghosted so they did not come up on any records. Except for this guy.”
He pointed to the computer screen and it showed a man in his mid 30’s with black hair. He was a medium build and not a bad looking guy.
“This man’s name is Arden Zechiell.”
“How do you know that?” Zoe asked.
“Well, it’s been the buzz on the deep net for the past few hours now,” Vance said. He lit a cigarette. “This mother fucker was completely erased from the database. Except for a show he played on five years ago. It’s some cheesy space trek show that only ran for one season called Solar Troopers. It was canceled due to low ratings but luckily for us it has gained a cult following since. He was some minor character… like a security guy or some shit. Anyways, the geeks pinpointed his ass and we verified. The guy from the show is an exact match to this guy here in every dimension.”
“So they forgot to erase his name from the credits?” Zoe asked with a smile.
“Those bastards didn’t think of everything. So, I managed to track down his nearest kin and according to them this guy was big into conspiracy forums before he went off the grid. It took some persuading but I got the name of a virtual forum that he became obsessed with. It’s called the Counterplot League.”
“I’ve never heard of it.”
“That is because it is on the Dark Web,” he said as he put out the cigarette in an ash tray beside the chair. “You need a special type of software to access it. Hence, it remains hidden from the rest of the Network. I put my people on it and they were able to find it relatively quick. You want to go for a dive?”
“Let’s do it,” she said as she lay on the chair. Vance took the chair beside her.
“Dive,” they said in unison.
Zoe’s thought prompted her neural crown to link into Vance’s. Their neural crowns shared a link so she was immediately booted up into his load out room.
“Iree,” Zoe said.
“Yes, Zoe?” Iree’s voice rang out.
“Set up a defensive matrix around both me and Vance’s avatar. Set conditions to match that of the Dark Net.”
“Understood,” she said.
“Okay, I’m sending you the software,” Vance told her.
The v-mail immediately notified her that she had a message and she downloaded the software.
“Implement current software,” she told Iree.
“Completed.”
“I think you should switch to a less conspicuous avatar,” Vance said. “People know the Red Lightning. You are pretty famous in the Net.”
“Switch to Avatar twenty two,” Zoe said. Her appearance glowed and she was transformed into a slim woman with long blue hair.
“Okay, I am going to prompt the address. Are you ready?”
She nodded. The bright green load out screen vanished as they were launched into one of the data streams at quantum light speed. In less than a second they were at the entrance to the Counterplot League. The “door”, which was only a visual representation to the data that it represented, was a modern white wood. The “building” was something that looked like an outlet of a mini-mall. Vance entered first and Zoe followed behind.
It looked more like a hang out than anything else, Zoe thought. There were various tables set about with different conversations going on. There was a bar of sorts, though it looked to be mainly for show.
“I will try this table, you try another and see what you can find,” Vance told her via neural message.
She walked over to a round table that was crowded except for one empty chair. She sat on it and began to listen to the conversation the people were having.
“It is obvious that the Legion is the result of a progressive radicalization that is trying to undermine the legitimacy of the aristocratic republic!” a young man said. He had black hair and Zoe thought he seemed a bit snarky.
“How can you say that?” a girl exclaimed. “This has nothing to do with progressives. This Super Dome attack was a false flag by the central government and you know it! Stop trying to stir the pot!”
“Listen, Jani,” the boy replied, “We all know that you are a bonafide socialist. How can we trust anything you have to say when your whole persona is based in debunking the current government. I, however, do not trust either the aristocracy or the socialist brain washers that are trying to upend the social order.”
“You have repeatedly established your views on autonomy, Berus,” said a short, chubby boy with round glasses. “Your bias is exemplary when it comes to getting the government out of everything. Even if it means public safety.”
“Look,” the boy named Berus said, “Why do you want some bureaucracy managing our every thought and regulating what should be a free economy in the first place? If I have to choose between safety and freedom then I choose freedom!”
“Your silver tongue does not hide the inherent logical flaw in your argument,” a silver haired young woman said. “What would progressives have to gain by demanding that we all evacuate the city? To undermine the aristocracy you say? Okay, well in what way will unleashing a deadly technovirus help the socialization of the middle class? You forget that has been and always will be the progressive movement in New Verum. Our cause is an economic one. It is also peaceful. Protesting has gained real ground in Districts five and six. Terrorism only sets the stage less voice to reason and more iron fist ruling that the city is accustomed to.”
“I would have figured you to be on my side, Freia, considering you are the niece of a Baron.”
“My loyalty is with both the aristocracy as well as the people. I have used my formal education as well as my social status to help those less fortunate.”
“Meanwhile, the policing of our individualism is taking complete control over every aspect of our lives!”
The table erupted in argument with everyone talking and yelling at once. Zoe tried to make sense of what was being said but it was an exercise in futility. After a few minutes they seemed to tire of it and it settled down.
“What about Arden Zechiell?” Zoe asked when there was finally a moment of silence. All eyes turned to her.
“Arden Zechiell?” Berus scoffed. “That loser was neither progressive nor autonomous. Hell, he wasn’t even political. He would just come in here blabbing about the Veritas Aenimus movement. He was full of zeitgeist shit.”
“I am afraid I do not know of the Veritas Aenimus movement,” Zoe said.
“I am sorry, who are you?” said the kid with round glasses.
“My name is Zozo, I am a new member.”
“Veritas Aenimus is a zeitgeist movement,” the girl called Freia said. “They believe that Network has developed a sub conscience of sorts. As a rejection to the status quo of New Verum. Or to put it more simply, the Network rejects our usage of the Network.”
“It’s bull shit,” Berus said. “He would say things like the Network was built by the ancients and we just adopted it. When everyone knows Aeon Tech invented the Network a hundred years ago. It’s not just science… it’s history!”
“So is Veritas Aenimus tied to the Legion somehow?” Zoe asked. She knew she was reaching.
“How the hell should I know?” Berus scoffed. “I mean it makes sense I guess.”
“Veritas Aenimus is older than the Legion,” the kid in glasses said. “So if that theory is to be believed, then the Legion would be a byproduct of the zeitgeist movement.”
“Interesting,” Freia said. “Though Veritas Aenimus has died down the past few months. You would think if they were connected, we would have heard more of it on the Net.”
“I don’t know. If the two were connected, why wouldn’t we hear about it?” Berus asked. “And more importantly, why wouldn’t the feds have already smashed up every Veritas Aenimus chat room on the Network?”
“That is a good question.” Zoe said. “But a more important one is, how do we know that this zeitgeist movement is not equipped with some kind of neural protocol?”
“Neural protocol?”
“Yes, like when someone that would be associated with the movement would trigger a cascade via something like a link or vmail,” Zoe explained. “If they could somehow gain access to someone’s neural network they could essentially wipe the memory of anyone who they did not find compatible with their agenda.”
“That’s bullshit,” Berus said. “If that was the case then Arden would have wiped our memories of him.”
“Unless he was not a member of the Legion then,” Zoe said. “It could be that Veritas Aenimus is a recruiting tool. Something to warm the person up for the Legion.”
There was a silence around the table.
“Where do you come from?” said the boy in glasses.
“I am sorry, I need to log now,” Zoe said as she stood up. She left the table and found Vance. As he saw her approach he stood up to meet her.
“Did you find anything interesting?” Vance asked.
“Maybe…” she said. “They were quite defensive when I brought up Arden.”
“Yeah, same here,” Vance said. “I did manage to get out of them that he stopped logging in here about six months ago. Before that time, he was a regular chat rabbit.”
Zoe looked behind Vance as she saw two men enter the room. One was a medium height with white hair and a trench coat. The other had black hair and a tribal tattoo that went up the link of his neck onto his right cheek. They came closer and then the white haired man flung both his hands up. As he did so, a pulse erupted across the room which froze everyone in place.
“We got two slicers on your six!” Zoe transmitted to Vance. “Iree, get us free of this neural shock!”
“I already got it,” Vance said. He moved swiftly and leaped under the table. He waved his hand and shot a proton burst at Zoe, freeing her from the shock. She dove beside him.
The tattooed man raised his fists and began to fire a steady proton stream attacking wildly throughout the room. As it hit the frozen bystanders, they were booted from the Network. The white haired man went for Zoe and with an open hand he fired a corruption blast. It was ineffective at penetrating her firewall and she used the stream to send back a worm into his neural network. He staggered as the worm weakened him and as he did so, Vance popped up and fired a proton burst which obliterated the man.
“These guys are using neural chips!” Vance said as he came back down avoiding the proton stream the other man was firing. “That blast fried that bitch! He wasn’t just booted!”
“Iree, give us some cover!” Zoe prompted. At her command, there formed three small walls that blocked the line of sight between them and the tattooed man. Both Vance and Zoe converged, one of them flanking left and the other right. Zoe peaked around the cover and the man fired a stream at her face. She barely made it back behind cover.
“This guy has some better hardware,” Zoe warned. “You don’t want to get hit by that stream.”
Vance fired another burst in the direction of the tattooed man. It missed but it came close enough that he was forced to move towards the door. As Zoe jumped out to attack, the man retreated outside.
“Fuck!” she said. “Get him!”
Vance was already en route. Zoe reached the exit first and as she went outside she saw the man approach the data stream.
“Iree! Track him!” she prompted and Iree managed to tag him with a tracker bug before he hit the stream. “Follow my neural pattern, Vance!”
She hit the data stream and was whisked away. As she traveled she looked down the quantum stream and saw the tattooed man. He was skating the stream like Zoe was but unaware that he was being followed. Zoe tried to hack his neural net, which was no easy feat considering they were both moving at faster than light speed.
She was unsuccessful but the man took notice. He turned around and fired a proton stream. It went well over Zoe’s head and she returned fire with a linked proton attack. The two proton balls left her hands and spun in on themselves spiraling towards the man. It caught the man in the arm but instead of killing him it took his arm off.
“Damn, that should have booted him,” Zoe said.
“I can’t get a shot,” Vance said as he skated behind her. “I am just going to boost your firewall as well as speed.”
She could feel his master program give her the boost she needed and she sped towards the slicer. He could see her gaining on her and he fired a stream. She put up her arms and the stream was dissipated as it struck her firewall. She overtook him and used a lasso to slow him down and then bring him to a stop.
Vance came up behind her. “Just keep him still, I am initiating the probe now so we can get a fix on his body.”
The man was struggling to get free but it was in vain. Iree had already taken over his motor functions and Zoe’s lasso tightened the more he struggled. He was caught and only a miracle could save him now.
“Almost got it…” Vance said.
As soon as the words came out his mouth, a beam of light shot past them horizontal of the data stream. Zoe looked to where it originated and could see a black avatar made up of one’s and zero’s that formed the shape of a man.
“What the hell?!” Vance said. Another blast came and Zoe let her lasso disappear and created a firewall around both herself and Vance. As the beam of light hit them the firewall shattered. The tattooed man skated away out of sight.
The black avatar, who was not on the data stream at all, but rather in the void of the matrix, flew towards them. He extended his hand and both Zoe and Vance were lifted into the air and off of the quantum stream.
“This is impossible!” Zoe said.
“You’re telling me!” Vance replied. “Probing now!”
The black figure looked at them and turned his head. He had no facial features but Zoe could swear that he was curious.
“I can’t get a hack to stick!” Zoe said. “Iree, command prompt!”
There was silence. Iree was offline. But, how?
The black avatar clenched his fist and as he did so Zoe could feel her throat tighten and she could not breath.
This is impossible, she thought. Somehow, this creature was making her unable to breathe in the real world. No hack she had ever heard of could effect your real world motor functions. The creature’s grip, however, remained and Zoe could feel her life force slowly fading.
She thought it was the end, when another figure emerged. This was another avatar made up of one’s and zero’s, though instead of being black, it was pure light. So bright that it was hard to see. It back handed the black avatar and the hold on Zoe and Vance was gone. They fell to the quantum stream gasping for air.
The black avatar hissed and then screamed. The sound was deafening as if the entire Network was in a fit of rage. Instead of attacking, it retreated into the void of the Matrix.
“What are you?!” Zoe cried. The creature turned to her. Instead of answering it raised its hand as if it was politely asking her to shush. It clenched its fist and as it did Zoe was booted from the Network and found herself back in the chair at the FIA headquarters.
“What in the hell was that?” Vance said.
Zoe stayed silent. Trying to figure out the answer to that question.
“I probed that fucker,” Vance said. “Whatever it is, it’s ancient. It was not a person, but more like the Network itself.”
“That makes no sense,” Zoe said. And yet, it was the only explanation that could make sense.
“Well, you know as well as I do that the Network is ancient,” Vance said. “We are one of the few that know that Aeon Tech just adopted the technology that was already here and used it to build their company. Whatever we just encountered is a product of that.”
“We should keep this between us,” Zoe said. “At least until we can make more sense of it.”
“Agreed,” Vance said. “I have the analysis of the creature. What my probe could get from it, anyway. I will send you the data and we can try to see what to make of it.”
Zoe rested her head back on the chair. She touched her throat and there was no physical damage to it. It felt though as if the creature, whatever it was, was able to reach out to her real body and strangle her. She did not like this at all. The Network was her territory and no one had ever been able to employ such dominance over her as this. Whatever these creatures were, she intended to find out. And the next time she would encounter them, she would be ready.


























Chapter 11

It was well into the early afternoon by the time Eva reach Baron Leland’s estate. The rain was a heavy downpour and it allowed for the smog to somewhat dissipate. Eva liked the rain regardless. It felt natural to her, something like an old friend. The dismal weather made the afternoon feel like evening, and it was at night when she felt like herself.
She had been working as an FIA agent for six months now. She had been assigned as Zoe’s partner for two of those months. This would be her first solo mission and she knew that had meant that Zoe trusted her now. Even though she was a real hard ass, Eva looked up to her. Maybe a bit too much, she thought. She could vaguely remember making a pass on her the night before. She shivered. Hopefully Zoe would realize it was the alcohol talking. She never made passes. Let alone at another woman. It was not that she wasn’t serious, but she did not want to give Zoe the wrong impression.
Hell, Zoe was the first person that Eva liked since leaving the Mage’s Consortium to become an agent of the Federation. Everyone was always so serious and direct. Though, admittedly, Zoe was too. With her it was different in that Zoe was deserving of her commanding presence. The way everyone just shut up when she entered a room as if they were in the presence of an idol. That was respect. And it was well earned.
Not the type of respect that Eva had in the Mage’s Consortium. She was an S Class mage. Meaning that she was born with the extrasensory perception that would allow her to learn two schools of magic instead of just one. The way the Magus Council treated S Class mages was ridiculous, or so she had always thought. S Class mages were born that way. It had nothing to do with the actual person.
What made it even more infuriating was the magic schools that espers would learn is also predetermined. Eva remembered hearing the calls from the astral planes when she was twelve years old. Usually, a mage would hear the call from only one of the planes. S Class meant that two planes called out to you. For a little girl it was more unnerving than the torment that a youngling mage would normally have to go through. Twice the torment, Eva thought.
Of course some mages lucked out on their callings. The water mages, for instance, had peaceful visions of the water realm where the oceans never ended and water golems danced along the surface like mythical fays. For each school it was a different calling and depending on the strength of the esper, the more prominent that calling would be.
For Eva, her calling was from the fire and shadow realm. There were many long sleepless nights of visions of the fire realm with all its inferno that never ceased. The hell fire and the brimstone that always churned as the fire golems burned and fought among themselves like berserk maniacs.
The day was filled with visions of the shadow realm, the nightmare that was pure darkness that never ended. The horror of it all came from the feelings of dread and sorrow that would overtake her as the shadow spirits would swirl around her. She could feel all their hopelessness of being trapped in that place. She would cry and cry with her parents unable to calm her or understand what it was that was causing this misery.
The Magus finally took her into the Consortium and taught her how to control and harness the visions. It would not be long until she was one of the most powerful younglings in the school. This also came at a price, for the other kids would always mock and shun her out of jealousy, as they did all the S Class.
And so she grew up in that place alone, as she had always been in her life. The Magus would train her to develop her powers. Given her schools, it was natural she would be trained as a weapon. She did not mind that really, she just wanted to be given the chance to earn the respect of those who would either give it to her freely, or those who refused to even give her the chance.
And now here she was, in this place, in Baron Leland’s estate. As she was led through the corridors, she could not help but marvel at the eerie feeling she got from the decorations throughout the huge mansion. Demons and monster statues littered almost every hallway. It had little else in the way of art but what it did have an abundance of was darkness. The whole place, as far as she could see, used candles to light the indoors and these were used sparingly. They were located only so far as so you could see one foot in front of you. It was in the darkness where she felt natural, and so it seemed also for Baron Leland.
The servant came to a stop at a pair of doors and knocked three times. After a moment, the door opened and the servant went in holding a hand up to motion for Eva to wait. After a few moments, the servant returned and made another hand gesture indicating for Eva to go inside.
As she entered the room, she noticed the darkness and how only a handful of candles were the only source of light giving the atmosphere a ghostly air. Standing by the desk was a white haired man.
“I ask you forgive the lighting,” the man said. “If it pleases you, I will ask the servant to bring more candles. I despise the bright light as I have bad eyes in my old age.”
“It is fitting,” Eva said as she walked towards the man. “I myself prefer the darkness. It is there that we are judged more honestly I have found.”
“Well said!” the old man said. He indicated a chair in front of his desk and Eva moved to it and sat. The man went behind the desk and sat also.
“Do you know why I am here?” Eva asked.
“I have my suspicions, though if you are here for what I think you are, then I am afraid you have wasted your trip.”
“Let’s just cut to it,” Eva said as politely as she could. “I have here a holorecording from General Renvar’s daughter. Do you know her?”
Baron Leland nodded. Eva placed the holorecord on his desk, a slender and flat device with a button and a small projector. He pushed the button and the image of Zoe appeared, only one tenth of her normal size, in a transparent blue form.
“Baron Leland,” Zoe began, “I am Zoe Renvar. You served with my father in the Turf Wars and it was there he claimed to have gained one of the greatest allies the city could ask for. What my father did not know was a secret that you hold dear. He did not know that you were really a vampire.”
Eva gauged for a reaction from Baron Leland but his face remained expressionless.
Zoe continued, “I want to assure you that those of us with this knowledge in the Federal Intelligence Agency are only a small handful of individuals. We do not hold any discrimination against what you are. Our only concern is to the safety of New Verum. In that I think we have a mutual trust and understanding. My father thought of you as a patriot and it is that countenance to which I appeal now. We need your help. To be specific we need your knowledge. There is a rogue vampire who has joined the Legion. He is a killer and a blood sucker. What he is doing to this city, if knowledge were to escape, would be irreparable to the vampire community as a whole. I have reason to believe that this vampire is hiding out in the Sanctuary. I implore you to give us any information you think would be valuable in our search. For the sake of New Verum I await your reply.”
Baron Leland sat back in his chair slowly. He sat there for a few moments brooding.
“That Zoe Renvar is surely as sharp as her father!” he finally said. “Tell me… I’m sorry dear… what was your name?”
“Eva Hyle.”
“Tell me, Ms. Eva Hyle, do you know what the Sanctuary is?”
“No.”
“I’ll tell you. The Sanctuary is the home of many vampires that dwell in New Verum. Yes, many vampires. The reason they live there is because they fear persecution from the rest of the city. It is a secret that is well guarded in my community.”
“I understand,” Eva said simply.
“The vampires are a very misunderstood species,” he said softly. “We did not ask to be vampires. At least not most of us. We were just victims of an all too often brutal violation. When bitten by a vampire, the disease is always transmitted to the host. That is the price of sustaining the carrier. In the Sanctuary, we have developed a way of life that does not require this cycle of violence to continue. It has been the work of me and my wife, who is also a vampire, to manufacture synthetic blood for our species to survive on.
“This revelation is not without its tax, however. When a vampire drinks human blood, we regenerate any wounds we may have suffered as well as reverse the aging process. As to how much of both, it all depends on the severity. I could drink the entirety of a grown man and only regain a decade of my past life. With this synthetic blood, we gain neither benefits. It only sustains us to live out a life which we would have as if we were normal humans. It has granted me a life as a Baron and others who want to remain living as a person would usually live their life. Most vampires do not trust humans and prefer to remain secluded. Thus the Sanctuary was conceived.
“I will give Ms. Renvar the location of the Sanctuary. I only ask that the vampire known as Vrykol be brought to justice.”
“Vrykol?” Eva asked.
“That is the name of the vampire that attacked Ms. Renvar. And before you arrest me for obstruction of justice I must say in my defense, we were not aware of it until only recently. It is a mere coincidence that our paths have crossed now. If not, I would have had to reach out to young Ms. Zoe in the fashion as to which we sit here now.”
“I understand,” Eva said. “I don’t think… I mean… You’re secret is safe, Baron Leland. Our only concern is catching this Vrykol as well as the rest of the Legion.”
“And for all those things, you have my thanks,” he said with a smile. “Now if that is all, I must ask for some privacy. I do enjoy this visit but I have other matters to attend.”
“Of course and thank you Baron Leland,” she said as she stood up.
The servant led her outside and Eva headed for her car in the parking garage a few blocks away. The rain had ceased but the sun was beginning to set. She made her way up the crowded street. This was her first time in District Nine and she noticed it was a rather poor district. It’s not as bad as the slums of the twelfth and thirteenth districts but it was pretty rotten. The roads had potholes and there were beggars everywhere. Not that Eva was overly concerned, she grew up in a similar district before she was taken to the Consortium.
The street in front of her was so crowded it was almost impossible to navigate. She thought about it for a second then decided to try and go around through the alleyway to her right. She started walking down when she noticed she was being followed.
She turned around briefly to see five men tailing her. She picked up her pace a bit and could hear them do the same. Then she turned around to face them.
“You guys, I really don’t want any trouble,” she said holding her hands up.
“That’s too bad,” one of the men said, a burly and ugly man with very few teeth. “Trouble has done found you.”
“Do you want my money? I can give you that,” she said as they got closer.
“No,” another of the men said. A smaller man but he looked to be more astute. “You have been snooping around where you aren’t wanted.”
“So you are friends of the Baron?” she asked. They were getting close now.
“For the Legion!” another of the men cried as he charged at her.
“Giesa Ento Measee!” Eva chanted as she weaved her hands in a S-like pattern. The man charging her stopped and began to scream is if he saw a monster. The other men became incoherent as well. She had cast a nightmare hex on the area and anyone who walked too closely would see a ghastly scene of demons and a hellish landscape. It was just an illusion, but to the eyes of those caught in the hex it seemed real as anything else they could perceive.
“What’s going on?!” one of the men cried out.
“Oh, fuck me! It’s biting my leg!” another man screamed and began to shoot his pistol at the air in front of him.
“It’s an illusion, you dumb shits!” said the astute man. He shook his head and Eva could tell the effect of the hex was wearing off on him.
She was already in the middle of casting another spell. “Enta Forlo Tamin!” she chanted and weaved. A flaming sword appeared in her right hand. “Todow Umpin Laro!” The world around her slowed down to a tenth of its normal speed. Or rather, her own perception of time had changed as she was now moving at ten times her speed.
She moved forward and to the eyes of the men in front of her she was a blur. She attacked the astute man first, bringing her flaming sword up into his groin and cutting him up through the stomach. The man to the right of him began to pull up his gun slowly and she spun around bringing her sword horizontally. She decapitated the man and as his head slowly fell from his body, she charged forward and then dived behind a dumpster on her left.
Time returned to its normal speed and she could hear the men shouting. The hex was losing its effect and the adrenaline of having seen their comrades die put them into a frenzy.
“Alor Denpo Ceenum!” she cried out, hands weaving a complex pattern. At the end of the weave, she drew a line in the air with her hand and a wall of fire emerged where she indicated. The flames caught one man in it and he yelled in horror as his body was lit ablaze.
“Shoot the bitch!” one of them cried and the two that were left began to shoot in her direction. She hid behind the dumpster and began to weave another spell.
“Hurom Loto Qetum!” The shadow of one of the men reached up and grabbed him and then pulled him into the shadow realm. The spell would only hold him there for a half of a minute at most so she knew she would have to act quickly to finish the man still shooting at her. She waited a few seconds until the shots stopped and he started to reload. She jumped out with her hand forward and used her power word. “Ignis!” A flamebolt shot out of her palm and hit the man in the face. The skin and front part of his skull melted away in an instant. He fell forward and went limp. She ran forward and picked up his gun.
It was then that the man she had trapped in the shadow realm emerged from his shadow. He screamed and wailed as do all who first emerge from the shadow trap. The effects of being in the shadow realm would drive the mind to the brink of insanity though the effects only lasted a few minutes when the mind would grasp that reality was as it should be. The man clung to her feet and was crying for help. She pistol whipped him in the head rendering him unconscious. She put a pair of hand cuffs on him and put her bracelet to her mouth.
“This is Agent Eva calling for a patrol pick up at my position.”
“Affirmative, Eva,” a voice called out from the bracelet. “A unit is en route. Do you require medical assistance?”
“Negative,” she replied. “Just hurry up with the patrol.”
She looked around at the carnage she had caused. In a way she felt sorry for the men. They had no idea what they were walking into when they decided to follow her. The mercy she felt was very brief, however, when she remembered these were members of the Legion. Their folly had now given the FIA their first prisoner that was an active member. It was that realization that made her feel a sense of pride. Not bad for her first mission, she thought. Not bad at all.





















Chapter 12

It was midday and the winds were strong, propelling the vessel forward at considerable speeds. They were in the area that the karkadanns were suppose to roam but so far they had not seen any sign of life. The ashlands were rugged and treacherous. It took very careful navigating on Sayda’s part to not collide with any gorges or crags. Azak kept his eyes peeled but it was not looking good. There had been no water or forage to be found so the chances of finding a karkadann were slim.
They pressed on, despite the feeling that this detour had been a waste of time and resources. Somehow they would make this work, Azak thought.
“We have less than a week’s worth of food,” Sayda finally said. “It will take five days to reach Armagetown. At that is only if we don’t run into any sandstorms.”
Azak grimaced. There would be sandstorms that much was certain. If they could find a watering hole, they could find a karkadann. With both of those things, they would have plenty of supplies to reach Armagetown.
“Let’s go ahead and park,” Azak told her. “We need to recalculate our route and see where the most likely watering hole would be.”
Sayda slowly brought the vessel to a halt. They went below deck and Azak pulled out the map. He pulled out the magnifying glass he had found and searched the terrain. The map was detailed but the ashlands changed dramatically with each season. What was once a hill could be a valley within the span of a year.
“Maybe once we get to Armagetown, I can find work,” Sayda said. “It shouldn’t take long to save up for the passage we need.”
“No…” Azak said as he concentrated on the map. “This is the ticket. I know it. It’s just… there is no telling how old this map is…”
Aybel approached and asked, “Do you need help?”
“No, Aybel, there is nothing you can do,” Sayda explained.
“You are looking for a karkadann,” Aybel said. “I can find one.”
“No baby,” Sayda told her.
“Really, I can. I can dream these things. It is why the bad men took me. Everyone always wants me to find things for them.”
Azak looked down at her. “How is it that you can help?”
“If I know what to look for I can dream it,” she said.
Not convinced, Azak frowned. “I do not understand.”
“Well, do you know how you dream when you sleep?” she asked. “I can dream when I am awake. In the dreams I can find things. I just have to know what I am looking for.”
Azak looked around the compartment for something to write with and found a piece of charcoal. He turned the map over and began to sketch a karkadann. He drew the big horned nose that connected to the head. Then he made the arched back and four legs.
“Can you find it with that?” he asked her.
“I think so,” she said. “The nose is pointy like that?”
He nodded. She sat down in the corner and closed her eyes. Moments passed and Azak looked at Sayda. She shrugged at him. Finally after a few minutes, Aybel opened her eyes.
“I found one,” she said. She ran up stairs. They followed. She pointed to the northeast. “It is that way. Not so far but we can’t walk.”
“Let’s see if she is right,” Azak told Sayda.
They continued their journey in the direction that Aybel had pointed. Every once and a while they would have to make a course correction due to obstructions but Aybel would just point and say, “That way!”
It was late afternoon when Azak could finally see a watering hole.
“I’ll be damned,” he said.
They stopped the craft near the hole and refilled all their canteens and flasks. Sayda suggested they should also bathe and so they took turns doing so. The girls bathing together first while Azak sat in the ship. After Azak had cleaned his body and put his clothes back on, he went back to ship and found Aybel below deck drawing a picture on the floor with the piece of charcoal he had found earlier.
“Do you know how far the karkadann is?” he asked.
“Not far now,” she said. She closed her eyes briefly then opened them. “He is tired. I think he will sleep soon.”
Azak looked at the sun that was fading. “Not a bad idea,” he agreed. “We won’t be able to hunt effectively in the dark. If you are right and he is close, then we can take him in the morning.”
They made a fire with some brush wood that was growing around the watering hole. Azak also managed to kill a nice size gecko which he roasted for the girls to eat. Aybel complained at first but after she ate she said it was actually tasty.
“How long have you had this power?” Azak asked her. They sat around the fire and Aybel clung to Sayda as they both sat on the ground with Azak not far from them.
“Since I can remember. Though on the last dry season is when the elders would ask me to search for the yale and other food because the tribe was having troubles. I liked doing it for them.”
“The Dread Lord must have discovered her powers from another caravan,” Sayda said. “He would always bring back prisoners for interrogation. It is likely one would have mentioned a girl with special gifts.”
“The Dread Lord is the bad man?” she asked looking up at Sayda.
“Yes, love.”
Aybel looked at Azak. “You are strong enough to beat him?”
“I’m not sure,” Azak told her. “I won’t let them take you.”
“How did you get your powers?” she asked.
“The Dread Lord gave them to me for helping him,” Azak lied.
“You helped him even though you hated him,” she said. Azak noticed that she was telling him rather than asking.
“Yes.”
“Me too,” she admitted. “He wanted me to search for something for him. A man… I could not find him though. He got angry. When he hit me I told him a lie. I said that the man was far away and that’s why I couldn’t see him. The truth is I can’t find him because I don’t know how he looks.”
Sayda held her close. “It’s okay, child. He won’t hurt you anymore.”
“I cried,” she said. “But not because he hit me. I cried because he killed my guardians and the elders and everyone else. I hate him. I hate them all.”
Azak thought of something to say to comfort her. There was nothing. In his heart he felt only emptiness. He knew that this child was perceptive and see past any hollow words he might have for her. Instead he began to sing.
“Nohdar homun exleetay mortoo. Enwixley tel morta fomun harto tu nolay tul o Etiyah.”
“Is that the song of your tribe?” Aybel asked.
“It is.”
“It’s pretty,” she said.
The fire began to die down and they went back to the wind sail. Aybel and Sayda went below deck and lay down. Azak remained to keep watch. There was no sound except the wind. He closed his eyes and could hear the faint sounds of someone in his mind. The voice was calling though he could not make out what was being said. It was louder than it had been at the Citadel but it still sounded like muffled nonsense. His only guess was that once they reached New Verum he would be able to make sense of this strange sensation.

The next day, they set out as soon as the sun became visible heading to the northeast.
“He isn’t far now,” Aybel said after they had been traveling for about half an hour.
Azak went to the bow of the ship and began to search. It was hard to see any tracks in the black sand but after a few minutes he spotted what were clearly footprints of a large beast.
“There are the tracks!” Azak called to Sayda as he pointed. She nodded and altered course to follow.
It was not long when the creature came into view. Its hulking figure was nearly as big as the ship. It’s long horn protruded up into the air and connected his nose to his forehead. His thick sheets of hide were like armor and formed together in an overlapping fashion. It charged forward on its massive four legs not seeming to notice them.
“Come up behind him!” Azak called out.
“Don’t hurt him!” Aybel cried out tugging on Azak’s tunic.
“Aybel, we’ve went over this already…”
“No!” she said. “I can talk to him and tell him to give us what we need!”
Azak winced. “What do you mean talk to him? We need his horn. Even if you could talk to him he wouldn’t just give it to you.”
“What if it’s just a piece?” she asked looking up at him with big green eyes. “He might let us have a piece if I ask.”
“I guess it can’t hurt to ask,” he finally said. “But if it doesn’t work I will have to kill him. You understand that right?”
She nodded. Then she closed her eyes. They were coming up behind the massive beast now. He noticed their presence and began to cry out. Azak formed a spear from the void in case he turned around to charge.
“Hurry up, Aybel,” Azak said as the beast began to turn around.
Then something unexpected happened and the karkadann went from a sprint to a trot until it finally slowed and sat on the ground.
“Bring us around,” Azak said. Sayda turned the wheel and stopped the craft a stone’s throw from the creature.
“Wait here,” he said with his spear still in his hand.
“No, I need to go with you,” Aybel said.
He frowned. “Fine. But stay well behind me. If he does anything I want you to run back to the ship as fast as you can.” She nodded.
They approached the karkadann which was laying on the ground now looking rather docile. When they got close the animal sneezed loudly. Azak jumped thinking it was going to attack but it just put his head down timidly. Azak slowly approached it and it did nothing but look up at him.
Aybel came up beside him and put her hand on the beast’s head.
“Aybel! What did I say?”
“She’s lonely,” Aybel said. “She is so sad. All of her friends are gone. She is the last of her kind.”
The creature made a loud sound like that of a horn.
“Aybel!”
“It’s okay,” she said softly. “She says we can have the tip of her horn. But only if we can promise that it won’t hurt.”
“I can do it without hurting her.”
Aybel closed her eyes apparently communicating with the animal. It made the horn sound again.
“She says she can even show us where to get food,” Aybel said turning to Azak smiling. “Berries, she said.”
Azak petted the creature. The hard leather plate felt impenetrable but the warmth coming off the creature was a stark contrast to his own cold skin.
“She will do all these things for us,” he said. “And yet we have nothing to give her.”
Aybel closed her eyes. “She wants to hear your song. I told her about it. She said she used to sing with her mate. He was killed by hunters.”
Azak patted her. “I… don’t know what to say.”
“Sing your song for her.”
Azak hummed the tune and then began to sing. “Nohdar homun exleetay mortoo.” The karkadann began to sing, its voice sounding like a trumpet. “Enwixley tel morta fomun harto tu nolay tul o Etiyah.”
The karkadann kept singing the tune and so Azak sung along. The song went on and on for many verses. Even Sayda had walked up to hear them. Aybel hummed along. After the singing, the creature stood up. Azak and Aybel took a step back. The creature put its head down offering the horn to Azak.
“She says she is happy now,” Aybel told him. “She wants you to have the tip for giving her this feeling.”
Azak formed a blade from the void and with a quick swipe cut the tip off the horn. It was about the size of the palm of his hand. The horn would grow back eventually and the cut did not seem to phase the creature.
“She wants to show us where the berries grow now.”
“Thank you,” Azak said bowing. The creature, seeming to understand the gesture, also bowed in response.
“Let’s go pick some berries,” Aybel said with a smile.





Chapter 13

They had arrived at the rendezvous ahead of time.
“So you said you know this guy?” Eva asked Zoe as they stood under a balcony avoiding the pouring rain.
“I have known him all my life,” Zoe replied. “He is my brother.”
“Your brother?” Eva said.
“He is… was… a vampire hunter. Among many other things. We need his expertise if we are going to the Sanctuary.”
“Do you think that is a good idea?” Eva asked. “The vampires are suppose to be peaceful. If we bring a vampire hunter in their midst… well… they are probably going to flip out.”
“Maybe,” Zoe said. “They know we are coming though you can bet on that. If we bring Kane along, they will think twice about trying anything.”
Zoe checked her neural crown and all her gear. Everything seemed to be there and functioning within parameters. She was anxious and noticed Eva eyeballing her.
“Are you feeling okay?” Eva asked.
“I’m fine. I am just ready to get this over with.”
A man on a motorbike pulled up. It was Kane. His short black hair and scruffy beard were visible even in the rain. The most prominent give away in his appearance was his cybernetic implants. His right eye and the surrounding tissue had been replaced by prosthetic. A metal case encompassed a cybernetic eyeball which was neon blue. His right arm was also completely cybernetic, it was metallic black and connected to his shoulder blade. A 12-gauge S1 tactical shotgun sat strapped to his back. He parked the bike and walked under the platform to greet them.
“It’s about time,” Zoe said.
“Chill, Zozo,” the man said as he lit a cigar. “Being early to everything does not really make you healthy and wealthy.”
“Eva, this is Kane. Kane, this is my partner. Eva.”
Kane nodded at Eva. “She is a cutey. A little young but I don’t mind.”
“Cut the shit,” Zoe said. “You did listen to all my vmail, right? I don’t have to go over the mission in detail again do I?”
“Relax,” he said puffing at the cigar. “We are going to the Sanctuary which you claim to know the location of to extract some dick name Vyrkol who is a member of the Legion which you and your FIA buddies have been getting your ass handed to you for going on over a year. Does that sound about right?”
“Do we really need to bring him?” Eva asked.
“That’s right,” Zoe said. “If you are going to be paid what was promised I want you to be professional. Is that clear?”
“Crystal,” he said. “Where is the entry point?”
“It’s near here,” Zoe said. “We have to enter the sewer via this trench. It’s gonna be wet.”
“Just how I like it,” he said as he began to walk towards the trench.
Eva looked at Zoe in distaste and then followed behind him. Zoe waited a moment and then did the same.
They came upon the trench which had a ladder that extended down into it. Kane went first followed by Eva. Zoe climbed down last and once at the bottom noticed the water was filling the center reservoir quickly.
“We need to find the entrance before we are knee deep in water,” she said.
“How far is it?” Eva asked.
“It should be up here a ways,” she said leading the way. After about five minutes of walking, they reached the entrance to the sewers. It was a door that was magnetically sealed.
“I got this,” Kane said as he pulled out a thermal torch. In a manner of minutes he cut off the handle and the door opened. They entered into the dark tunnel.
Zoe turned on her night vision visor that extended from her neural crown. Eva cast a spell that made her eyes glow a dark purple and allowed her to see in the dark. Kane had no need for either with his cybernetic eye.
‘Iree, load up the schematics for the sewers and superimpose the map to the Sanctuary,’ Zoe prompted. The tactical display showed up in the corner of her vision. It would take the forefront of her display with the proper thought command. Zoe led the way as they headed deeper into the tunnel.
“Smells like ass all right,” Kane said.
“What do you expect?” Eva asked.
“Hell, I don’t know. They could wire up some air freshener or something. Not that I mind a little ass now and again.”
“You’re disgusting,” Eva chided.
“Down this ladder,” Zoe said. The ladder was fifteen meters down. Zoe went first and once down at the bottom did a visual sweep of the area. They were in a service tunnel and there were various electrical pumps and conduits running down either side. No signs that anyone had been in this area for some time. She felt a chill run down her spine and a sickness in her stomach.
“You going to be okay, sis?” Kane asked.
“I’m fine,” she said moving forward.
They continued their path down into the tunnel. After about a kilometer or so of walking, the tunnel sloped downhill sharply. They made their way down carefully holding the handrail so as not to slip. After the tunnel leveled off, they came upon another door. It opened with no problem and Zoe entered it. They were now inside a huge room that connected many other tunnels and passageways. It was circular and spacious both in height and width. There was a pool of water at the center where various pipes dumped their contents into.
“Careful not to slip,” Zoe said noticing the floor was wet from the mist being thrown up from the reservoir.
“No worries,” Kane said. “If one of you fall I’ll swim in after you.”
“We need to go down to the next level,” Zoe said ignoring him. “There are some stairs over on the other side.”
She felt her head starting to ache and she became dizzy. She waited a moment for the feeling to pass and continued on. They walked down the stairs when out of nowhere, a giant splash landed near Zoe. The splash consisted of some kind of acid and she turned around to see what it was that had caused it.
“It’s a goddamn titanoboa!” Kane shouted as he pulled his shotgun off his back and fired a slug.
A massive snake, around thirteen meters, sat on the other end of the platform. It had reared its enormous head vertically and spat another glob of venom in their direction. It almost hit Eva but she dodged it by retreating back up the stairs. Kane’s shell hit the beast in the neck but it barely seemed to notice. Zoe pulled her pistol out and loaded a clip of explosive rounds. She fired a couple of times and the bullets erupted on impact. This sent the snake into a frenzy and charged at them.
Both herself and Kane ran the opposite direction as the snake lunged. It missed and pulled its body up onto the platform where they had once stood. They both fired at it unloading a barrage of slugs and explosive rounds. Their concentrated fire tore a hole in its neck but did not kill the beast. Instead it spit a chunk of venom at them. It landed in between them and splashed. Kane cried out as a piece hit him on the side. Zoe’s fusion shield evaporated the venom as it made contact but in doing so the strength of the shield failed which meant she was now exposed to any other attack.
“Inda Morto Legna!” Eva cried from the upper floor. Zoe could barely make out the weave she made in the air but she could clearly see the fireball that shot from her hands. The giant red ball made a streak in the air as it soared towards the giant snake. When it made contact with the snake’s head, it exploded and the shock wave knocked both Zoe and Kane up against the wall. When she got up, she looked at the snake which was now headless and then fell harmlessly over the side into the water.
Eva came down the stairs towards them. “I’m sorry,” she said, “But I had to use a powerful spell in order to kill it. Are you okay?”
“I’m fine,” Zoe said as she knelt down to check Kane who was slouched against the wall holding his side.
“Damn, bastard,” Kane said. “That’s what I get for not investing in a fusion shield.”
“I got some bio spray here,” Zoe said pulling off the tube from her belt. She sprayed the wound which nullified the acidic effect of the venom.
‘Iree, determine the effects of the venom,’ she prompted and her neural interface began to analyze the wound.
‘The venom of the titanoboa will be fatal if antidote is not consumed within twenty four hours of contact to the bloodstream.’
‘Link to the antidote ingredients.’
The list appeared on her visor. She knew that she did not have what she needed.
“Damn,” she said. “We will have to go back. Otherwise, the poison will kill you.”
“It’s all right,” Kane said as he stood up. “I got nanites in my bloodstream. They can fight the venom for a good long while.”
“According to my database the venom will kill you in twenty four hours,” Zoe told him.
“Then that means I have a week,” he said. “That’s plenty of time to get Vyrkol and get the hell out of here.”
“It’s your call,” she said reluctantly.
“We complete this mission,” he said. “Now let’s go.”
She led them into the next tunnel which was a large pipe that sloped down further into the belly of the sewers. There was a catwalk that went along the side of the pipe which they walked on. The further they went down, the more Zoe felt sick. The dizziness began to increase and her legs started to feel weighted. They finally came out of the pipe and into a square room which seemed to house some kind of check valve. There was an array of pipes and valves as well as gauges and meters.
“Where to next?” Eva asked.
Zoe prompted the map which came up. Her dizziness was now all she could focus on. She felt like she had to vomit.
“Are you okay?” Eva asked her.
Zoe nodded and took a step forward. She fell down and hit the ground hard. She broke into a seizure.
“What is wrong with her?” she could hear Eva say as her body convulsed.
“She is claustrophobic!” Kane said as he turned her over on her side. “Ever since she was trapped in that damn building as a kid she hasn’t been able to handle enclosed spaces!”
“What do we do?”
Zoe felt Kane give her an injection. Her body slowly stopped convulsing.
“That should calm her down,” Kane said. “I gave her a large dose of Benzo. It will suppress her feelings of fear but it will take a while to fully take on her.”
“We’ve got company!” Eva yelled. Zoe could hear the sound of Eva chanting spells and the sound of Kane’s shotgun. She tried to ask what was happening but instead she just slipped into unconsciousness.


























Chapter 14

The room they were in seemed to be some kind of water storage tank, Eva thought. She looked around for some form of weakness in the structure.
“You’re wasting your time,” Kane told her. “This tank is magnetically sealed. Shooting fireballs will only burn up the air we have.”
“Shit,” Eva said. She looked at Zoe who lay on the floor unconscious. “How long will she be out like that?”
“I don’t know,” Kane said as he slowly sat down and leaned against the wall. “Maybe an hour. Maybe longer. The dose of benzo I gave her was pretty heavy. When she wakes up she will feel like a million bucks at least.”
“What about you? You look like shit.”
“Ha! So they tell me.”
“No. I’m serious,” Eva told him. “That venom is doing work on you.”
“I’m fine,” he said. She did not believe him. “Those damn vampires took us by surprise, sure as hell. I bet they were stalking us since before the snake even reared its head. You know vampires don’t give off body heat. Meaning the snake probably can’t even sense them.”
“Seems like a mutual friendship,” Eva said.
There was a sound at the door. The latch groaned and the door opened. A man walked inside.
“The Conclave will see you now,” the man said. “Which of you is the leader?”
“I’ll go,” Eva said looking at Kane. He nodded.
“So be it,” said the man. He led her outside of the cell. Another man who was outside shut the door behind them. Eva thought about melting them both with a spell but decided against it. She was led around various corridors and passageways. The smell here was not that bad, she noticed. They entered into a large room where a number of people sat on large chairs on the opposite end of the room. The man led her to the center of the room.
“You stand before the Conclave of the Sanctuary,” the man told her. He departed and Eva looked around at her captors. There were various ages and genders among the vampires staring at her. The one at the center was an older man with long brown hair and very pale skin.
“What business do you have for this intrusion?” the pale vampire asked her.
“We are looking for a vampire named Vrykol,” Eva told them. “We only wish to take him from this place and into the custody of the Federal Justice System. He is wanted for crimes against humanity.”
“How did you find out about this place?” asked a woman to the right. She had long blonde hair that she wore in a braid.
“The Sanctuary was revealed to me by Baron Leland,” she told them. “He said that the vampires who lived here would be cooperative in apprehending the suspect if we give you our word in keeping this place a secret.”
There were murmurs and whispers among the Conclave. The pale man in the center raised his hand and the others fell silent.
“You invade our sovereign and make demands of us,” he said. “What makes you think we even know who this Vyrkol is?”
“You know who he is,” Eva said. “He is the blood sucker and murdering vampire who has sworn allegiance to the Legion.”
Again more murmurs and whispers. The man did not waste time raising his hand.
“You now make accusations,” he spoke loudly. “Tell me why we should just not execute the three of you and be done with it?”
“For one thing, if we do not return to the surface within forty eight hours then the location of the Sanctuary will be broadcast all across New Verum. Second of all, it is in your best interest to see Vyrkol brought to justice. Vampires like him give the rest of you a bad name. He is a liability at best.”
“You speak boldly for one so young,” the pale face told her. “I must commend you for that. We will give you Vyrkol. In return, you must leave this place and never return. We value our privacy above all else. Vrykol has become stricken with blood lust and his actions have brought unwanted attention on the rest of us.”
“I thank you,” Eva told him. “I assure you that you have no need to fear anything from me and my companions. We will take Vyrkol and leave as soon as we are able.”
The man nodded and made a motion with his hand. The vampire who led her in returned and escorted her out of the chamber. He led her back to the place where Zoe and Kane were being held. Once there, he ordered the guard to free them. Kane came out first, still clutching his side. Zoe followed slowly behind him. She looked a bit dazed, but awake.
“They have agreed to give us Vyrkol,” Eva told her.
“Good work,” Zoe said. She looked pale and weak, Eva thought.
“They going to give us our shit back?” Kane asked looking at the man.
“This way,” he said. He led them into another room where all their equipment was.
Kane strapped his shotgun to his back and put his utility belt on. He took an inhaler out of one of the pouches.
“Take this,” he said handing it to Zoe. “It will help your system stabilize the side effects of the benzo.”
She reluctantly took it and inhaled the medicine. She put her own belt on as well as the rest of her equipment.
“Where is Vyrkol?” Zoe asked the man.
“Right this way,” he said and led them back out the way they had came. He took them to another water tank. He nodded at the guard who opened it and entered. He brought out a man of medium height who had long black hair and a rather young and handsome face. He wore black suit that looked torn and worn out.
“Is that him?” Kane asked Zoe.
“That’s him,” she replied.
Kane lifted his shotgun and pointed it at Vrykol. “Alright, fucker. You’re coming with me. And if you so much as sneeze in a way I don’t like I will blow your hand off. Do you understand me?”
Vrykol said nothing. Instead he just stood there. Zoe tied his hands with a thin wire made of Elterium, a very flexible but virtually unbreakable metal. Kane walked behind him and poked his shotgun into his back.
“Let’s go,” Zoe said and they were led to the entrance of the Sanctuary.

Zoe led the way as they navigated the complex system of sewer. She seemed to be doing a lot better and Eva thought she could see the confidence return that was so much a part of Zoe’s demeanor.
“You do realize that this is all in vain,” Vyrkol finally said. His voice sounded pleasant and mysterious, Eva thought. “I will never give you the location of the Legion nor the antidote to the technovirus.”
“Shut the fuck up,” Kane said. “Or would you rather I shoot your dick off?”
“I just want you to know that your efforts are futile,” the vampire responded. “Everything that has transpired is a part of a greater plan than any of you can comprehend.”
Kane hit the man in the back of his head with the butt of his shotgun. He fell to his knees.
“Get the fuck up!” Kane said as he pulled him to his feet.
They continued their journey and hours passed but Eva was now able to orient herself as they passed by familiar rooms. They came across the big room in which they fought the titanoboa. They made their way up and out of the room and continued on.
“Hold up,” Kane said. They stopped and he vomited. Eva watched Vyrkol in expectation that he would try to use the moment to escape. The vampire seemed uninterested in what was going on and just stood there.
“Alright, I’m good,” Kane said. He looked bad, Eva thought. His skin was pale and had a green tint to it. He was sweating profusely. He still carried himself in that arrogant way but it was obvious the poison was taking its toll on him.
“It’s not far now,” Zoe said. They continued on until finally arriving at the entrance to the sewers. They went outside into the trench. The rain had stopped and it was in the early morning. The sun was barely visible and the smog had set leaving an orange mist limiting their visibility. They reached the ladder and Zoe climbed up first. Kane sent Vrykol up next while he quickly followed underneath him. Eva waited until Vyrkol had reached the top before making the climb. She found the three of them at the top with no signs of struggle. She found it odd that Vrykol was making no attempt at escape given the nature of his crimes.
They walked back towards where they had parked their vehicles. The building in which they had avoided the rain came into view. Beyond that was their vehicle though Eva could not see it through the fog. Zoe looked around with her gun drawn and her thermal visor active. Kane began too cough violently until blood started splattering from his mouth.
“Watch Vyrkol,” Zoe told Eva as she checked on Kane who had fell to one knee.
“I’m fine,” Kane said. “It’s just the nanites getting rid of the poison in my lungs.”
He stood up and looked around. He grabbed Zoe and yelled, “Get down!” and as he did so a rocket exploded in front of them. They were all thrown into the air from the shock wave. It took a moment for Eva to orient herself. Kane had pulled her behind the wall of the building out of the line of sight of whoever had fired the rocket. She looked around for Vyrkol. He stood a few feet beside her looking totally uninterested in what had just happened.
“I didn’t see where it came from,” Zoe said with her pistol held in the high ready position.
“I saw them,” Kane said. “They are up on the balcony in the building to the left of your car.”
“Were there anymore?” she asked.
“Not that I could see,” Kane said. “If I was a betting man I would say they aren’t alone.”
“Stay here and guard Vrykol,” Zoe said. She turned on her active camouflage and ran around the corner.
Eva could hear gun fire and then the sounds of another explosion. She looked at Vyrkol who still just stared blankly into the fog as if daydreaming. Kane began to cough intensely again. He slid down the wall into the sitting position. Eva bent over to help him.
“Don’t worry about me,” he said holding a hand up. “Just make sure that dickhead vampire doesn’t escape.”
Eva could hear more gunshots in the distance. She turned to Vyrkol who met her gaze.
“There are forces at work here you could not imagine,” he told Eva. “The Second Cataclysm is upon us.”
Then on their right flank, she spotted a man in a black robe come around the corner carrying an assault rifle. He fired in their direction spraying wildly and the shots zoomed past them.
“Ignis!” Eva cried out firing a flame bolt at the man. The small fireball streaked through the air with a fierce hiss. It struck the man square in the chest and he fell back instantly dying as it tore through his rib cage.
“We need to move!” Eva told Kane. He struggled to stand up.
“Just go without me,” he said sliding back down.
Another man appeared from around the corner and threw a grenade their way. It landed right in front of them.
“Stun grenade!” Kane shouted and as he did the world lit up in a bright white light.
Eva tried to dive out of the blast radius but it was to late. The world faded around her as she slipped into unconsciousness.




















Chapter 15

“Stay here and guard Vrykol,” Zoe said. She turned on her active camouflage and ran around the corner leaving Kane, Eva, and Vrykol behind. As she rounded the corner shots rang out from atop the balcony and bullets whizzed past hitting the wall behind her. Another rocket fired and exploded well in front of her. She hid behind a pillar as the shock wave roared past her, hurling stone and metal in its wake.
They have thermal goggles, Zoe thought. She made another run for it sprinting underneath the balcony trying to limit her attackers line of sight as best as she could. She only had the general direction of where they were so this was nearly impossible. They shot at her but she could tell by the sprays that whoever was doing the shooting were not professionals. Their bursts were uncontrolled and she easily dodged the wild spurts.
She reached the other building where the shooters were and dove behind the corner of the building into the alleyway. As she landed, she did a roll and quickly sprung up. As she did so, another explosion rang behind her. Debris hit her shield but did minimal damage.
‘Iree, were you able to effectively scan my attackers?’
‘The limited scan revealed at least three attackers on the balcony,’ Iree told her.
Zoe looked ahead and she saw three men run past the opening of the alleyway. It looked like they were on their way to flank Eva and Kane. She rushed forward in an attempt to catch up with them. She saw two more men run past and as she came around the corner she fired her pistol in their direction. The bullets hit the closest man in the back and he fell face first into the concrete. The other man rounded the corner. She charged forward and briefly looked at the man she had shot. He was dressed in the same robes as the Second Cataclysm clergy.
She peaked her head around the corner and shots rang out. One bullet grazed her shield bringing the strength to half. Two men had stopped running and were instead turned and firing on her. She went back around the corner as they continued their spraying. She waited until the first one began to reload and then made a dive around the corner falling into the side prone position. She shot at the man who was still firing and a bullet sliced through his arm and he staggered. She fired another shot that hit him in the forehead.
The other man had finished reloading and he raised his rifle to shoot. Zoe had already lined up her pistol on the man’s face and fired. The bullet ripped into his eye socket and he fell dead. She stood up and shots rang out from the direction she had come from.
Damn, she thought. She was now dealing with attackers from both sides. She would have to leave Eva and Kane to deal with the ones she was chasing and deal with the immediate threat. She put her back to the corner and when the sprays stopped, she peaked her head to see four men taking cover behind a car and a dumpster. They began to fire in her direction again.
“Fuck!” she said. This was going to take a miracle to get out of. Even though they were not professionals, they were packing military hardware and utilizing cover. She made a run for it down the street towards them. Shots rang out around her zipping by and popping cement up in the air in front of her. A few bullets caught her shield. She made it behind a steel trash can and bullets zipped by. She fired a few shots at the men and a bullet hit her and broke her shield. She crouched down behind cover.
This is it, she thought. There was no way to survive a full minute to let her fusion shield to recharge. Then, as if the One God himself could feel her desperation, an airship appeared overhead. It was a hornet class gunship and it lowered directly above Zoe’s position. The craft had a center pilot seat which was protected in bullet proof glass. The wings were two rotary propellers that pushed the air fiercely in all directions around Zoe. The stinger came down in a curved angle which harbored the fifty caliber gatling gun. The gun begin to spin and bullets sprayed out. Zoe got up and ran the way she had came in order to dodge the hot shells that began to rain down on the street. The men who were firing at her were quickly ripped to shreds by the gunship as the fifty caliber bullets turned them into gore.
Two more airships flew down past where the men where. These were carrier class ships that held strange metallic cargo underneath. They flew low and dropped their contents. Two massive robots stood up and began to look around appearing to scan the area. They paid little attention to Zoe and instead began to fire in the direction towards where the initial battle was taking place. Zoe could hear the enemies firing back at the robots but the bullets just bounced harmlessly off of their bulk.
She stood in awe at the machines. They were bipedal as they walked on two legs but their massive arms carried heavy fifty caliber gatling guns similar to those on the hornet gunship. They also sported rocket launchers on their backs and the sleek designs of their torso gave them a vicious look. The heads were small domes and the visor that she supposed served as their eyes seemed to be able to view the world in a three hundred and sixty degree configuration.
The machines began to work their way down the street and Zoe ran to follow them. She looked around the corner to see black robed men being ate up by fifty caliber rounds. There were two men on the balcony and one had a rocket launcher. He fired at the leading robot and the missile exploded. The machine barely seemed to notice despite having a rather small dent in its chest. It responded by unleashing a barrage of small rockets from its shoulder which obliterated the two men in a shocking explosion.
The machines rounded the corner and they engaged what Zoe believed to be her original attackers given the trajectory of fire. She quickly sprinted to catch up with them. She took a hiding place on the opposite end of the street behind a car. The black robed men were desperate now and firing everything they had. The machines raised their arms up and unleashed both their machine guns saturating the area with bullets. The entire balcony as well as the floor that it sat on was enveloped in fifty caliber bullets. The men who were firing at them were little more than body parts sprayed across the balcony and the street below.
Zoe stood up and ran to where she had left Eva and Kane. The machines completely ignored her. She rounded the corner only to find that there was no one there. She noticed the ground where they had stood held a residual blast of a stun grenade.
“Damn,” she said. They had been taken. More airships entered the area. This time they were transport ships and they landed in the parking lot behind her. Military police began to pour out of the ships and searched the surrounding area and buildings. Like the machines, they ignored Zoe. Then she saw a man she knew exit from one of the dropships. It was her father.
“How did you know?” she asked him as she approached.
“Baron Leland sent us a message saying you might need some help,” her father said. He looked more stoic than usual as he normally did when there was a combat situation.
“Were those machines the BARCs from Omegacorp?” she asked him.
“Indeed,” the general told her. “We needed to test them in a real setting and this seemed a good time. It seemed to pay off for you.”
“How do you control them?” she asked.
“They are mostly ran off of AI, however we upload their mission objectives and parameters into their database which is stored on the Network. It is rather sophisticated if not a bit controversial.”
“I imagine so,” Zoe whispered.
“Are you hurt?” he asked her sounding concerned.
“I’m fine,” she replied. “Kane and my partner were captured. They also took our detainee.”
“Any idea who might have taken them?”
“I know exactly who did it and where they are,” she told him.































Chapter 16

“This is not your standard contract,” Shifty told the man. “If you want us to hunt down Kaypac, who has completely went off the radar, it is going to cost double the normal rate.”
Shifty was a slim guy, or so he was told. His black dreadlocks were long and he was pale due to spending most of his days sleeping. The team he was a part of was known as Triptech and they worked mainly at night. He wore an old military suit that he had bought at the army surplus store a while back along with his neural crown that he only removed when he was sleeping. His arms and body were covered in various tattoos and he wore *large stretched earrings*.
The man sitting across from him was named Vance. Some Federal Agent that needed some dirty work done. He claimed that the FIA was stretched too thin due to the Super Dome crisis. It was probably true. Shift knew that this was an opportunity to make the extra credits his team was sorely lacking.
The Triad was a Runner group. They did various jobs for the wealthy that could not be handled in the legal realm. This would often involve hacking, corporate espionage, and other various activities. Times were tough with all the crackdowns and the team could not even afford a broker to find them the proper jobs they needed. Not only that, they had accumulated quite a bit of debt the past year as a result of a few jobs going sour.
“Money is not an issue,” Vance told him. “I will give you double. Half now and half when the job is done. Plus I may have more work for you after this.”
“I know times are tough,” Shifty said. “The thing is… I know who you are. I know what you do. I know of your buddy. Red Lightning. She is a fucking legend in the hacker game. A fucking god.”
“What is your point?” Vance asked as he lit a cigarette.
“My point is how do we know that the two of you won’t turn your sights on us when you are done with these terrorists? Once the Legion is dust then it’s open season again. How do we know we are not paving the way for our own demise?”
Vance exhaled smoke from his nose. “We don’t give a shit about your operations. We never have. Me and the Red Lightning are focused on national security. What you do in the shadows barely makes our radar. And when it does… Well, let’s just say that it is of mutual benefit for us to be friends. You get out of line then we just nudge you back on track. Simple as that.”
“And when you need to operate outside the line?”
“Well… you have your jurisdictions and we have ours.”
Shifty thought about it. The money was too good to pass up, he knew that. He knew that Vance knew that. Meaning that this was not so much a negotiation as it was a sizing up.
“What can you tell me about Kaypac and the Legion?” he asked.
“Well, Kaypac is a technorapper as you already know,” Vance explained. “Our only interest in him is he may know where Arden Zechiell is.”
“That’s one of the suicide bombers from the Super Dome, right?” Shifty asked.
“It is. Arden managed to ghost himself from the Network. All traces of him virtually are gone besides that damn show of his. We need to know what we can about him. Including how they are deleting themselves from the Network. If you find out anything in regards to this, then consider it a bonus.”
“Deleting yourself from the Network…” Shifty said. “That takes some serious hardware to even attempt that. Do you have any fucking clue how vast the Network is?”
“Don’t forget who you are talking to,” Vance reminded him. “You need to be aware of some things. This is not your typical Runner job. There are some serious hazards on this job.”
“Such as?”
“Well, as you know the Legion recruit people via the Network. We have been at a loss as to how they have been doing that. One of my colleagues managed to bring in our first prisoner of war. After quite a few extensive tests, we discovered that the man had severe neural trauma in his frontal lobe. I’ve had neurologists as well as my best people, including myself, study the findings of this damage. The conclusion is he was effected by a neural virus.”
“You’re shitting me…”
“Though our findings are still in the preliminary stages, I believe that the Legion is nothing more than a computer virus.”
“Fuck me running,” Shifty whispered. “How is that even possible?”
“There is one more thing…” Vance said. “We encountered something in the Net. Some kind of creature. It seemed to be protecting the Legion and for all we know could be the cause of this whole mess. Whatever it was it was sentient and it is powerful. It subdued me and Red with little to no effort. If you see this thing, my only advice is to get the fuck out immediately.”
“Anything else you want to pile on?” Shifty dared to ask.
“Just watch your back,” Vance told him. “In and outside the Net. Shit has a habit of hitting the fan lately and you are jumping right in it.”
“Cleaning up shit for people like you is what the Triad does best. When do we start?”

After Vance transferred the credits to the Triad account, he left. Shifty went to the back room where his partners were. Their hideout was a meager place, a rundown building that at one time served as a mechanic shop. The backroom was where they spent most of their time. What once housed car parts and other various accessories had become the Triad’s hub of operations.
He saw his two teammates as he entered the room. Twink sat at her table fiddling with one of her droids. She was a kindred spirit to the droids in which she owned treating them more like people than machines.
Twink was a small and slender girl standing only at one and a half meters. She had pink hair which she always wore in a three pronged pigtail. Her clothes were baggy and of the techno urban style, particularly the huge pull over coat she wore that engulfed her tiny body and went almost all the way to her knees. She kept it unzipped most of the time with one side falling over one of her shoulder. She wore only a bra underneath making it very distracting to talk to her to those who were not used to it.
“So what did the spook have to say?” she asked not looking up from her work. She popped her bubblegum as she always does.
“Gave us a job,” Shifty said going to his workbench. “Paid us half up front. Twenty-five thousand.”
“Fuck off!” she said as she dropped her tools and spun around to face his direction. “Twenty five grand?! What is the job?”
“He wants us to find Kaypac,” he replied as he began to search the clutter on his desk.
“The technorapper Kaypac?”
“That’s right,” he said as he pulled out his neural crown from underneath some magazines.
“Hey, Dozer!” she yelled at the orkin that was sleeping in the bed off to the corner. “We got a job! Twenty five K! Can you believe it?!”
The orkin’s eyes began to blink. “What did you say?” he asked.
“We got us a fuckin’ job, bruh!” she said louder this time.
He sat up and rubbed his eyes. Dozer was an orkin which was one of the more exotic looking of the meta humans. Instead of a nose they had a snout. His teeth were large and sharp especially for the two lower fangs that extended up and outside of his mouth. His ears were pointed and his skin was a yellowish tone. His mo-hawk he wore was a bright green color.
Dozer’s arms and legs had been completely replaced with cybernetics. Unlike most people who received synthetics due to some sort of accident, Dozer voluntarily underwent enhancement surgery. Orkins were naturally stronger than humans but with his cybernetic arms and legs his lifting and striking power were exponentially increased.
“What kind of job?” he asked as he moved to sit on the side of the bed.
“It’s a government contract,” Shifty explained. “They want us to hunt down a guy named Kaypac.”
“You mean the technorapper?” he asked curiously.
“Same one!” Twink chimed in. “What they want with him anyways? They trying to spruce up the Forum? Get some kick ass tunes to debate with?”
“Apparently one of the suicide bombers from the Super Dome attack was part of his entourage. The spooks seem to think that he may know something about the Legion.”
“The Legion?” Dozer said. “We getting involved in that shit?”
“They already paid us twenty five grand, bruh! Can you believe it?!”
“Twenty five… fuck me running!” he said shaking his head in disbelief. “Up front? Man, they got to be desperate!”
“Seems like it,” Shifty said. “I am going to do a Net dive and see what I can find on the chatterbox. You two need to go re-up on supplies. Do an inventory and then go shopping.”
“Man, I’m going to get me one of those new P38 microfusion motors from Alphatech!” Twink said standing up.
“Well, only if I can get a new reflex scope for my PM5,” Dozer said. “I’m tired of using those iron sights.”
“Pick me some armor piercing rounds,” Shifty said. “Can’t think of anything else.”
“You got it!” Dozer said. “Come on, chica! Let’s shop ‘til we drop!”
“Fo’ sho’loco!” she replied.
They left leaving with Shifty sitting at his workbench. He moved over to his couch and laid on it with his head propped up on the side.
“Dive,” he said and he entered into the Network. On his load out screen, his virtual intelligence wardens greeted him as they buzzed around. There were three of them in all, little balls of light which he had named Quarks. They served a number of purposes such as artificial avatars equiped with virtual intelligence that could act as both anti-virus and cyber combatants. It had taken him years to design them and when he had, the whisperers on the Network gave him the name Hadron.
‘Bring up Kaypac and all essential records,’ Shifty prompted. The first quark morphed into a floating screen and began to show various records and pictures.
‘Do a search for all of Kaypac’s known music and then superimpose all of his chords into any new technorap songs that have been released within the last week.” The second quark changed into a similar screen except it was filled with sound wave files and in a matter of seconds had a list of songs ready for review.
‘Run a search on known technorap hotspots. Limit to clubs and music venues.’ The third quark morphed and brought up a list.
‘Run a cross check. Parameters: Known locales Kaypac has visited within the past year. Similar wavelength songs. Overlap with known clubs and venues.’
The three quarks spun on each other and a screen formed above them. Shifty looked at the results. There were two places on the list. One was a club called Silver Lining and the other was the old theater, the Imagine Concert Hall.
‘Are there any surveillance footage on the Net from the two listed places?’
One of the quarks broke off and formed a screen that showed various security footage of a club which was obviously the Silver Lining.
‘Run a sweep to match for Kaypac’s body type and facial construction. Include following variables: Facial reconstruction and cybernetic implants.’
The quark spun and then the screen reappeared showing three men.
‘Do a record check on the following men.’ The quark spun again and brought up records of each individual men. That meant that these individuals had been in the system since birth. Meaning none of them were Kaypac.
‘Am I to understand that there is no security footage of Imagine Concert Hall?’
‘Affirmative,’ the quark responded.
That is the perfect hideout for Kaypac, Shifty thought. He would still be able to do what he loved while avoiding being traced on the Net.
‘Jump,’ Shifty said. He was booted from the Net and was back in the Triad base. He took the neural crown off his head and set it on the desk.
“Well, Kaypac, it looks like you are going to be our ticket out of this dump,” he said with a smile.













Chapter 17

Armagetown came into view and Azak felt a wash of relief roll over him. Their biofuel was almost depleted and the wind had been working against them for days now. They had to run the hover engines in order to make the last one hundred kilometers.
“We made it,” he said as he looked at Sayda who smiled. It was good that she was starting to smile, he thought. There was a weight that lifted off of Azak when she did so.
“Are the people here nice?” Aybel asked.
“Nicer than the ones we met before,” Azak said. “We still need to be careful. Always. Do you understand?”
She nodded.
“Will we be able to get some more food?” she asked. Both her and Sayda had been eating berries for a week straight.
“Yes, the money we get for the horn and the wind sail should be enough for a room and plenty to eat,” he said. “I will try and book passage for New Verum as soon as possible.”
They approached the walls of the city and Sayda hit the pedal that shut off the hover engines. The vessel slowed down to a crawl and then stopped at the gate. The wall consisted of scrap metal and was around four meters tall. The gate was made up of steel plates. Two guards sat atop the wall looking at them.
“What’s your business?” one of the men asked. He was a dirty man in goggles and his clothes were ragged. He carried a rifle which he held but he did not point it at them.
“We have come to trade and seek passage to New Verum,” Azak said.
“Ain’t no boats running,” the other man said.
“Why not?” Azak asked.
“What you got to trade?” the man asked ignoring Azak’s query.
“The boat and a few other things,” Azak responded. The two men whispered to each other.
“We’ll let you in,” the man said. “But you are gonna need to speak with the boss if you is wanting to trade.”
“Who’s the boss?”
They ignored the question and left from the top of the wall. Moments later the gate opened slowly. Azak nodded at Sayda who hit the pedal to activate the hover motors. They rode through the gate and into Armagetown.
Armagetown was a meager place. The houses and buildings were made of scrap metal and other various debris that looked to have been salvaged and acquired over a long time. The whole town stunk of raw sewage and Aybel pinched her nose in disgust. The people milling about glanced at them as they passed giving them disgusted looks but were not threatening.
“Park over there,” Azak told her pointing at an empty lot near the wall. “We can use the boat as a shelter until we sell it.”
Sayda guided the wind sail to the plot that he had pointed to. She hit the foot pedal and the hover engines shut off and the boat rested on the ground.
“Wait here,” Azak told them. “Go below deck for now.”
He hopped off the boat and saw two guards approaching him. They were different than the ones at the gate although they were just as ragged.
“Greetings,” Azak said. “We are looking to trade.”
“Trade has been suspended in Armagetown,” one of the men said. They looked at the vessel curiously. “Where you get a ride such as this?”
“I bought it,” Azak told him. “Traded a whole seasons worth of pelts for it actually.”
“Traded it?” the man scoffed. “I never seen a bucket like this in all my life.”
“Well, the technology is from the north. It works like a charm. That is when the wind blows your way. Otherwise the engines require biofuel to run.”
“You’re going to need to talk to the boss if you are wanting to trade,” the other man told him.
“Where can I find him?”
“Come with us,” he said. They led him up the hill to the back of the town. The city was muddy and wet. Azak guessed that the ocean water had something to do with that. Perhaps they had a crude sewer system that leaked. Either way it made walking a laborious chore as well as dirty.
They came to the top of the hill where a large building stood. It was built out of scrap metal like the rest of the town but this one seemed to be well crafted. As if care and planning had went into its design rather than having been thrown together like the rest of the shacks.
“Don’t you go pissin’ the boss off now, ya hear?” the man told him. “He’ll throw you out of town quicker than shit if so.”
“I’ll do my best,” Azak told him. He pushed the door open and walked in. He entered into a large room that was dimly lit. Utility lights that were running off a generator in the corner of the room gave very limited visibility of the room. They pointed to the back of the room where a group of men were gathered standing over a table. Azak approached them.
“Just give me ten good men and I’ll rout the bastards. I promise you that!” one of the men was telling what Azak presumed to be the “boss”.
“Don’t go fuckin’ up my shop!” another man said. He was a grizzly looking older man with a long white beard.
“Shut up and let me think!” the boss told them banging his fist on the table. “Damn that Daryen! Who would have guessed that dickless bitch would take up arms against me. It’s thrown everything into a cluster fuck!”
“Excuse me,” Azak said. “I hate to interrupt but I only just arrived in town. I am looking to trade and gain passage to New Verum.”
“There is no trading to be had right now,” the older man said. “Those damn thugs following Daryen have taken control of my shop. Until we can do something about them then ain’t nobody trading nothin’!”
The boss held his hand up to silence the man. “That’s enough Alren. From where do you hail traveler?”
“My name is Azak, from the Eltiya tribe of the Arid Plains.”
“Well, Azak from the Arid Plains, I am Solomon. I am the mayor of Armagetown though most people just call me boss.” Solomon was a tall man with long brown hair and a hard look about him. There was a scar just under his right eye.
“As you can see we have something of a predicament,” Solomon continued. “We have a bit of an uprising on our hand. Though I exaggerate on their behalf because they are no more than common criminals who have taken their grievances to the extreme. I have tried to resolve this matter peacefully but they are forcing me to drastic measures.”
“You can’t attack them!” the old man cried. “My shop! If you ruin my shop then you will set the trade back for years!”
“Silence you old fool!” Solomon growled. “Do you expect me to let them shut down the operations of the entire town any longer? If I let this fiasco keep going on then what is to stop anyone from doing the same any time things do not go their way?”
“But my shop…”
“Enough! I’ll hear no more of it. Now, if you will excuse me…”
“Perhaps I can help,” Azak said. They all looked at him curiously as if he were joking. “How many men did you say are holed up in your shop?”
“Six…” the old man said.
“Silence fool!” Solomon said.
“I can eliminate them,” Azak said. “In return I want a fair trade on the goods I brought. And I will also be needing passage to New Verum as soon as possible.”
They all started laughing. The man beside Solomon spoke first. “What do you hope to accomplish going in there by yourself? You are one man.”
“I will find a peaceful resolution if possible,” Azak said. “If none is to be found then I will kill them. If that is to your satisfaction?”
“I like your style,” Solomon said. “I tell you what… You can attempt to do what you just said.”
“Boss! You can’t be serious!”
“I am serious. You have four hours, Azak of the Arid Plains. If you are not back before then we will take back the shop by force.”
“I understand,” Azak told him. He left them to their business and walked out.
The two guards that had escorted him were still standing there.
“I need you to show me to Alren’s shop,” he told them. They looked at him blankly. “The boss said I am to start a dialogue with Daryen and his men and convince them to lay down their arms.”
The guards started laughing. “You serious?” one of the men asked.
“I am.”
“Well, it’s your funeral. Let’s go.”
They led him down the hill into the muddy streets towards the west wall. They came to a large building that had about a dozen guards posted outside of it.
“This is it,” the guard told him. “That bastard Daryen might shoot you as soon as you open the door.”
“I will be careful,” Azak assured him.
“Hey, you lot!” the guard told them men. “This here fellow is going to go in! By permission of the boss!”
They all grumbled among themselves but none of them offered any signs of protest. Azak walked to the door and slowly opened it. There were no shots fired or any sound at all. Azak walked inside.
The building was dark. What little light there was, came from the cracks in the roof. He looked around the room and could see the men in the back. They eyed him suspiciously as he walked forward.
“That’s far enough!” one of the men said pointing a rifle at his head. “Who are you?”
“My name is Azak, I come from the Arid Plains. I was sent by Solomon to establish a dialogue so we can end this stand off peacefully. He wants to put this matter behind him so that trade can commence in Armagetown.”
“Bullshit!” the man said. “Ain’t no way Solomon wants a peaceful end to this.”
“I assure you that is what he wants,” Azak told him. “If you do not comply then they are going to take the building by force.”
The men began to grumble and talk among themselves.
“We can’t fight them all,” one of the men said.
“Which one of you is Daryen?” Azak asked.
The man who was doing the talking originally said, “That’d be me.”
“What can I do to convince you that you can trust me?”
“Not much I am afraid,” Daryen told him. “If Solomon sent you that means he is playing some kind of angle. The question is what is it?”
Azak held his hands up in the air and slowly began to approach them. “I do not know how this quarrel got started friend. I just need to get to New Verum. If I can understand what has caused this dispute, maybe I can help you in some way.”
“Don’t trust him!” one of them men spat.
“There is no harm in telling him,” Daryen said. “The truth is we are tired of Solomon. We are fed up how he has used us to make him rich while leaving the rest of us to starve. This was the only way to make him listen.”
“I see,” Azak said as he stopped his approach. “A hungry man is a dangerous one. I do not wish to further antagonize you. I have to tell you though that it is imperative that I reach New Verum. That means that I have no choice but to end this conflict by any means necessary. Do you understand?”
Daryen pointed the rifle at Azak’s head. “I think it’s you who doesn’t understand. I am sorry that we are getting in the way of your ambition. That does not mean that we are just going to give up our leverage for some stranger. You understand I am sure.”
“I have to warn you,” Azak said. “That I am no ordinary traveler. I am a sorcerer.”
“Bullshit!” one of the men said. Daryen did not seem to be convinced either and kept his gun pointed at Azak’s head.
“If I decide it then I can kill all of you,” Azak told them calmly. “If you let me help you, then I can protect you from Solomon’s wrath. If you want I can convince him to let you join me and we can leave to New Verum together.”
“Prove it,” Daryen said. “If you are a sorcerer then prove it.”
Azak nodded. Each of the men looked at him with anticipation and he returned their stares. He transformed into his shadowform and with the darkness of the room his silhouette was hidden from their eyes.
“What in the hell!?” one of the men said followed by other exclamations from the rest. Azak moved under the men and then behind them without them noticing. He remained concealed in the darkness while they searched for him.
“It’s some kind of trick!” one of the men proclaimed.
“How in the hell is it a trick? He just up and disappeared!” another said.
“Alright,” Daryen said. “You’ve made your point. Come on out.”
Azak materialized behind them. “I wish none of you harm,” he said. “As I said before, it is imperative that I gain passage to New Verum. Right now you are in the way of that.”
Daryen turned around to look at him. The other men raised their rifles as they turned to face him. Daryen put his hand up.
“Lower your weapons,” he said. “Let’s hear what this Azak of the Arid Plains has to say.”











































Chapter 18

The light was dim and the air was dank as Eva sat in the cage that was her prison. She could not speak due to the device that her captors had put around her neck. The device was called a choker, it suppresses the voice box from being able to produce any sound. Her hands and feet were bound behind her so she could not weave or cast any spells. The only thing she was able to do was listen. And her captors, in all their conceit, let her listen to everything they were saying.
She counted five people total. Two of them she knew, Vrykol and the Archbishop Wido whom she had met with Zoe at the Church of the Second Cataclysm. The other three individuals were unknown to Eva.
She could only guess that the man in the white lab coat was some kind of scientist or technician. He wore a pair of round glasses and his head was bald at the top. The man seemed to be very nervous in the presence of the others. He seemed to be someone who did not belong in all of this yet still enough of the Legion to not warrant restraints of any kind.
“You were suppose to bring me the girl, Zoe!” the man said anxiously.
“You have the brother,” Vrykol told him. “That should be enough. The great Dr. Griffin is a miracle worker when it comes the DNA. Were those not your words before I was sent out to be used as bait?”
“I have no idea of the man’s genome sequence,” Dr. Griffin said. “I have no idea how the annunaki protein will react to him. It may mutate or completely dissolve his DNA.”
“How long would it take to manufacture more of the protein if that were to happen?” Archbishop Wido said. Eva found him to be more brooding that before. Like he was a different person than before.
“It could be months!”
“Then you best pray that his DNA accepts the protein, Dr. Griffin,” the unidentified man said. Eva felt a feeling of dread at hearing him speak. The man was of the elfen race and from what Eva remembered, he seemed to be a Dark Elf. He had long ears and long silver hair. His eyes were a solid white except for his pupils which were blue. He wore silver plated armor and he had a large two handed sword strapped to his back.
“I assure you, Prince Sol, that if the protein is compatible I will find a way to make it work,” Dr. Griffin told the man as he bowed his head.
“Now that I have arrived, things will be different,” the one known as Prince Sol said. “The Legion belongs to me now. I sent Wido here only two years ago. In that time he has tilled this city and its inhabitants to seek the will of Lord Deus. There are things in motion that none of you can imagine. You may call yourself Legion but your pathetic revolution falls short to the glory of our Lord Deus. We have allies everywhere.”
He looked at Eva and she felt a chill run down her spine. “We also have enemies attacking from all sides. They are relentless and if we are not vigilant, then fires of heaven will consume us all.”
“Well said,” Wido told him. “What is our next phase, Prince Sol?”
“I want you to deal with the government,” Sol said. “Engage them. Lead them to believe that you are the head of the Legion giving the rest of us free reign.”
“Understood,” Wido said with a sweeping bow. He left the room.
“What would you have me do, my Prince?” Vrykol asked him.
“You will remain here for the time being. Mani and I will wait for the Child of Id to arrive. There is nothing else to be done until that transpires.”
“As you wish,” Vrykol said. Eva noticed he did not bow.
Eva looked at the woman beside Sol and wondered if that was Mani. She was a Dark Elf and looked to be the identical twin of Sol. She had long silver hair and wore a silky light blue robe. Her eyes were covered by a white cloth. Eva remembered reading that Dark Elves were known to go blind when exposed to sunlight.
“The Child will be here soon,” she said. Her voice sounded soft and beautiful as well as sad, Eva thought. “If my Dreams are correct and the Voidmancer succeeds in his next battle.”
“Your dreams have always been reliable,” Sol said. “I will see to my acolytes. You will remain here, Vyrkol. If anything happens to the prisoners I will hold you responsible.Doctor, you are to administer the annunaki protein at once.”
The two of them left leaving the doctor and Vyrkol. When they were gone, the doctor began to mutter to himself as he walked over to what looked to be a primitive operating table where Kane was strapped to. He lay there unconscious and Eva had to wonder if the poison from the titanaboa had finally killed him.
“You bring me a brother when I ask for the girl,” Dr. Griffin said as he rummaged through a tray of medicinal tools. “A poisoned one at that. How am I suppose to administer the genome alteration with a half dead man?”
“You will do it because your life depends on it,” Vrykol said. “Prince Sol will kill you if it fails to take. He really could care less either way is the feeling I got from him.”
Dr. Griffin looked at Vrykol through the top of glasses. “Who is this Prince Sol? I can never keep up with who is leading this outfit. I thought your cult was suppose to listen to Wido. He is at least a reasonable man. Reasonable for a terrorist anyways. This Sol seems to be some kind of sadist.”
“You might want to keep that bit of information to yourself,” Vyrkol said as he approached Eva’s cage. “I would hate to see him gouge out your eyes like he does to his acolytes.”
The doctor ignored him and lifted a needle and filled the syringe with some kind of substance that Eva assumed to be the annunaki protein they kept talking about. He looked at the dosage carefully and then stuck Kane’s arm and injected the black liquid. He pulled the needle back and sighed.
“Time will tell if his body takes it,” he said. “If he dies from the poison then it means the experiment was unsuccessful. If that happens then it may be both of our lives that Sol takes.”
The doctor left the room while Vyrkol stared at Eva. Vrykol pulled out a set of keys and opened the cage door. Eva watched him carefully as he stepped inside.
“I am sorry that this happened to you,” he said. “It was necessary I am afraid. There are things going here that I cannot explain right now. If you are smart then you will do everything you can to stay alive. This man… This Prince Sol… He is very dangerous. He will destroy this city if left unchecked.”
Eva’s eyes narrowed. She wanted to yell at him. Tell him that this was all his fault. She wanted to ask him why a scum such as him would care about what happens to the city.
“I don’t ask you to trust me,” he said apparently sensing her frustration. “Just listen to what I am telling you. Sol and his twin sister are desperately searching for this Child of Id. I do not know the details behind it but when whoever that is arrives to the city… That will be our time to escape. I need you to keep calm and not draw attention to yourself until then.”
She stood up to her feet and spit at him. He wiped the spit from his cheek.
“I understand how this looks,” he told her. “Just know that what I have done was for the benefit of not only my people in the Sanctuary but all of New Verum. With time I hope that you can come to see that.”
He stepped out of the cage and locked it leaving her in silence.





































Chapter 19

The small assembly had been gathered with the goal of taking the first offensive attack against the Legion. Standing around the table were Zoe, her father General Martuk, Baron Leland, and Baron Vlad. Zoe had never personally spoken with either of the Barons though she knew their reputations quite well.
Baron Leland was a vampire and partly responsible for this whole mess they were in now. Zoe did not begrudge him for that because now they did have a better picture of the organizational structure of the Legion. She was still annoyed that because of the turn of events he had to bear some of the responsibility in her brother and partner being captured.
The other man’s name was Baron Horatio Vlad. He was a shrewd man with a notoriety of being the most influential Baron of New Verum. The other Barons respected and listened to him and he was well loved by the people, both the aristocrats and the proletariat. He was a tall man with long black hair and a handsome face. His blue eyes had a piercing effect that demanded your full attention if his gaze rested on you.
“Please, Ms. Renvar, tell us what you know about where they have taken this vampire you had in custody,” Vlad said to her.
“The men who attacked us were clergy of the Church of the Second Catalcysm,” she said. The men stared at her without a hint of surprise. “I am convinced that the Archbishop Wido is in control of the Legion and has been pulling their strings from the beginning.”
“How can you be sure?” Baron Leland asked.
“I visited the Archbishop recently and according to him he had excommunicated two of their clerics some months back. What he did not realize was that the records of both men were wiped from the system a year ago. Even with the practices of their religion, the ability to wipe yourself from the Net is an expensive and rigorous process. It is also virtually impossible to remain in civilized society after being ghosted to that effect even in such a secluded place such as a religious convent. The Network is constantly collecting feedback from citizens and residents who dwell in New Verum and for them to remain unnoticed by the Church of having no virtual identity is impractical at best.”
“This is not enough to condemn the Church,” Baron Vlad said. “They have roughly three million members and make up the second largest religious organization in New Verum. Without concrete evidence we cannot go public against them.”
“The men who attacked me were Cataclysm clergy,” she said. “This is the second time I have been attacked by them. If you do not want to go public with this all the better. I have jurisdiction on this matter that supersedes all but the Prime Director when it comes to the apprehension of those involved with the Legion.”
“You do not have to remind me of the ratified amendment which grants you this power,” the baron replied. “I was the one who spoke up for you in order to get the motion passed. I can only caution you that we are on a slippery slope and if the archbishop is as diabolical as you claim, he will only use this to his advantage.”
“We have to act fast before they have time to react,” she said. She looked at her father. “General, I want you to set up a perimeter around the Cataclysmus Cathedral. Make sure that no citizen enters the zone and make sure no one gets out.”
“I assume we are going to use the BARCs in this incursion,” the general replied.
“Yes, I want the BARCs centralized around the building as support. We use military police for the perimeter. I will leave the assault team to your discretion.”
“We will use the Dragoons,” he said. She nodded and felt relieved. The Dragoons were the elite forces that specialized in urban pacification. 
“We will need to spin this in regards to the media,” she said looking at Baron Vlad. “Otherwise the Prime Director will come down hard on all of us.”
“I will put out a statement saying that the Legion have taken the Archbishop hostage and that we were forced to send in a team for extraction. The political implications should be minimal if things were to go wrong seeing as how we can put any blame on the Legion.”
“If I may ask,” Baron Leland interjected, “How is it that the Legion came upon the information of your mission to begin with?”
“I have my suspicions that I am not at liberty to say,” she replied.
“I want you to know that while it looks like I am the mole, nothing could be further from the truth,” he said. “I believe that there is an extensive network aiding and abetting the Legion for their own political gains.”
“I trust you, Leland,” General Renvar said. “I assure you that you are not a suspect in this and that we have known for some time that there are those in the government who are actively working to undermine the Prime Director’s vision of a unified and cohesive government.”
“Just to be clear,” Zoe said, “Everyone is a suspect as far as I am concerned. Regardless of your records or relationship to me. I am not going to discuss these issues at this time, however. Right now, the best all of you can hope to do is cooperate in this mission. I say this with the utmost respect to each of you. I know of your contributions to this city. What we have with the Legion completely undermines everything that the creed of New Verum stands for. All I will say at this point I believe that the Legion have infected all aspects of our society and that includes the Forum and the military. You know if you are innocent and if you are not and my advice to you is keep your ears to the ground.”
“Boldly spoken,” Baron Vlad said with a smile. “You are truly the image of your mother. I can assure you that each of us is fully ready to provide you the resources and support you need for this mission and also in the future.”
“Alright,” she said. “Let’s do it then.”

Zoe boarded the transport ship that housed the rest of the dragoons. She took a seat at the front and began to do a check of her inventory. She carried a S4 carbine which fires a 5.56mm armor piercing round. The magazine capacity was fifty and it came equiped with a miniature reflex sight designed to work in sync with a neural crown. It also has an S203 single shot microfusion grenade launcher.
The soldier in front of her spoke. “The Dragoons are ready for your command, Agent Renvar. I am Lieutenant Commander Kason Reid.”
“Alright,” Zoe said. “We will operate under your discretion. You know your team better than me. If there is a possibility of taking prisoners, do so. Otherwise, shoot to kill. The objective is the complete pacification of the Cathedral.”
“Understood, ma’am,” he said.
Zoe spoke into her comm bracelet. “Let’s move out.”
The convoy went airborne. It consisted of various airships and military personnel. Zoe waited patiently in anticipation. It took about ten minutes to reach the Cathedral and Zoe watched as it came into view.
“We’ll enter from the front with a breech charge!” Lieutenant Kason told the squad. “Yousef and Jaelynn will enter via the side entrance! Makenzie and Reece through the back! The rest of us will come in hot and heavy! If anyone is armed you are authorized to terminate with extreme prejudice!”
“Stand or die!” the dragoons chanted which was their infamous battle cry. The airship dropped down swiftly and the green light lit up. The dragoons piled out of the side one by one and Zoe followed. The Lieutenant was the last to disembark.
Zoe looked around at the other airships dropping off their own troops and BARCs. Hornets began to fly overhead scanning from above. There were no fireworks yet. So either the Legion did not know they were coming or they were waiting to engage them on the inside.
“Look alive people!” Lieutenant Kason yelled. “We don’t get paid by the hour here!”
The dragoons moved up the large stairway to the front door in tactical methodology. Zoe came up in the rear so as not to get in their way. One of the dragoons set up some breech charges on the front door. When he was done, he stepped out of the way and looked at the Lieutenant. He gave the nod and then pushed the button and the doors were blown inward. The dragoons poured into the building and Zoe followed.
The Cathedral was dark and they all turned on their night vision. Zoe scanned the large sanctuary for signs of movement but there was nothing from what she could see. Then all hell broke loose.
A man from atop the balcony ran forward shooting a rocket propelled grenade and the explosion caught a dragoon in its radius. The man went flying though, whether he was alive or dead, Zoe could not tell. The other dragoons quickly cut the assailant down with concentrated fire and as they did, more Legion poured into the room from various entry points.
“Fire at will!” she heard Lieutenant Kason yell in her comm. There was fire coming and going from every direction as dragoon and Legion engaged in combat. Zoe focused on her own surroundings and took cover behind a pew. Bullets whizzed by her as she crouched. She peaked over and took aim at the balcony where there were a group of men firing heavy machine guns down on them. She took aim at the closest man and unloaded on him with her carbine. The man was raked with bullets and fell forward falling from the balcony.
The two remaining men saw her and focused their fire on her. She ducked barely escaping getting mowed down. She ran down along the pew as it was being ripped to shreds. She dove behind the next pew and got up as she rolled over to her feet. She came around the corner to find a man in a black robe with a shotgun and she put two bullets into his head. She got down behind the side of the pew where he was.
“Mop them up!” Lieutenant Kason yelled. Zoe peaked over and could see that the enemy was all but dead or dying. The dragoons had taken a couple of casualties from the looks of it but most were still standing and were unharmed. After a minute or so, the shooting stopped.
“We lost Johan,” one of the soldiers said over the comm.
“Do a sweep of the room and make sure we aren’t going to get shot in our ass,” Kason ordered.
“What we have here is the beginning of the end!” a voice rang out through the sanctuary.
“Does anyone have a visual?” Kason asked and no one responded.
“The Second Cataclysm is a glory that you will not live to witness I am afraid,” the voice said again. Zoe recognized it to be the voice of Archbishop Wido. She looked around and then saw him. Or what she thought must have been him though what she saw defied all logic. A winged figure dove from atop the balcony and streaked across the room with amazing speed. It dove down quickly and picked up one of the dragoons carrying him up. Shots rang out and the winged figure went up onto the balcony above Zoe. Then the body of the dragoon fell down beside her. The man’s skin had been completely flayed from his body.
“You are among the honored few to see the evolution of the human species,” Wido cried out. “This is the true power of the Legion! I will take my place beside Lord Deus as the first annunaki to have been born in a thousand years!”
Shots rang out again directed at the balcony overhead. Zoe made a run to the podium in the front of the Sanctuary. She turned around to see Wido dive down into the pews. The shots that were being fired at him were somehow being redirected around him as if he had some kind of shield that deflected the paths of the bullets.
“Your primitive weapons are no match for me as I am now,” Wido said. His voice echoing across the sanctuary.
He held his hand forward and the man standing in front of him exploded in a flash of gore and light.
“What in the fuck is this?!” one of the soldiers was heard.
“Concentrate your fire on the creature!” Lieutenant Kason yelled. Zoe as well as the rest of the dragoons fired on the demonic figure of what had once been Wido. The creature was over two meters tall and while it had the face of Wido the rest of his body had been completely transformed. He had long black hair with long horns coming out the top of his head. There was a third eye that sat vertical on his forehead. His arms and legs looked like that of some kind of reptile with black leathery skin. His wings stretched out in a massive span that was both horrific and awe inspiring.
All of their efforts in subduing this creature was to no avail. None of their shots penetrated the invisible barrier protecting the creature. Instead he pointed his hand to each of the dragoons and as he did so, they erupted in an explosion of light.
“Get your people out of here!” Zoe cried.
“Fall back dragoons!” Kason yelled over the comm. Then he himself erupted in a blaze of light and gore.
Zoe decided to make a run for it. The entrance was too far away so she chose the hallway to the right. As she began to run that way, Wido took notice of her and leaped at her. The speed and distance at which he traveled took Zoe by complete surprise and his hand came forward and lifted her in the air as if she was a rag doll.
“Oh, how the mighty have fallen,” Wido said mockingly. “The great Zoe Renvar in all her pretentious zeal and arrogance.”
His hand closed around her throat suffocating her. She looked down in horror as the three eyed demon blinked at her smiling menacingly.
“You will not die today,” he said. “Your bloodline is to pure. I want you to know that all your efforts are null. Prepare for the end of New Verum as you know it. The Second Cataclysm is nigh and you are now a witness to its testimony.”
He threw her at the podium in which she hit it with such a force that she immediately fell unconscious.











































Chapter 20

“Alright,” Daryen said. “You win. We will leave with you.”
“Good,” Azak replied. “I will make sure that Solomon and his men offer you safe passage out of the city. Once we leave Armagetown, you will be free of any reprisal.”
The men all agreed that Azak would do the talking when they left the building. If it was necessary, they would let Daryen speak. As for the rest of them, they would follow their lead. Azak opened the door to the shop and stepped outside.
The sun shown brightly. It was more bright than he remembered it being in a long time. His eyes adjusted as the other men followed behind him. He saw them surrounded by Solomon and his guards. They had guns pointing at them. Then he saw Sayda and Aybel standing beside Solomon. They were held by two guards who did not seem the least bit friendly.
“Solomon!” Azak said. “What is the meaning of this?”
“So, you succeeded after all,” Solomon said with a smile. “And you did it all without killing a single one of them. I am impressed.”
“These men are under my protection, Solomon,” Azak told him.
Solomon laughed. “You’re protection? Just who do you think you are? This is my town. Here, I am the king!”
“No one is questioning your authority,” Azak replied. “I gave these men my word they would not be harmed. Now release my traveling companions. I do not wish for there to be any bloodshed.”
“Just shut the fuck up,” Solomon said with a wave of his hand. “As for Daryen. You have caused me enough trouble.”
Solomon pulled a revolver out of his coat and aimed it at Daryen. Azak put himself in between them.
“So you want to die? Fine,” Solomon said as he cocked back the hammer on his gun.
“Stop it!” Aybel cried out. Solomon smiled.
A horn blew from the gate of the city and Solomon and his guards turned to face it. One of the guards on the wall ran to a bell and began to ring it.
“Raiders!” the man could be heard screaming.
Solomon uncocked his gun. “You three! Watch them! If they move then shoot them.” He and the other guards left to the gate.
Azak tried to walk that direction to get a better understanding of what was happening.
“Stay there!” one of the guards said brandishing his gun. There was gunfire from atop the wall. They were shooting at something on the other side and shouting orders. Azak could see Solomon climb the wall and look over. He began to bark various orders. Then something struck the gate and shook the wall. The guards began to shoot erratically. The banging on the gate continued and became more forceful. The gate began to bend in on itself until if finally flew off the hinges and crashed on the ground.
The guards began to panic and Solomon ordered them off the wall. Men began to pour into the town. Azak recognized the men immediately. They were necrofiend acolytes. They charged in shooting and cutting men down. Then Azak saw Rook with his massive bulk come charging in swinging his massive hammer.
The guards that were ordered to keep an eye on Azak and the others were now preoccupied with what was going on at the gate. Azak used the opportunity to form a voidspear and he quickly stabbed two of the men before they could react. The third man turned around to fire his gun but Daryen shot him in the head.
“I need your help,” Azak said. He pointed at Sayda and Aybel. “Take them somewhere safe and hide. You are no match for that.”
Daryen nodded. “Come along now,” he said as he led the girls.
Azak ran down the hill and then took his shadowform. He climbed up the wall of a nearby building and materialized when he was on the roof. He formed his sling and began to hurl voidstones at the acolyes which exploded upon impact. With all the chaos going on around them, it took a while before they took notice of him.
When they did, they began to converge on him. He took to the shadowform again and retreated to another building. When he materialized, they were still surrounding the previous building. He launched more voidstones at them and watched as they obliterated the men.
“Azak you bastard!” he heard Solomon say. A bullet whizzed by his head. He turned around to see Solomon standing atop the wall aiming his revolver at him. He shot again and missed. Then a massive hand reached up and pulled him from the wall. It was Rook. He grabbed Solomon by the head and squeezed. Azak watched as the man’s head exploded like a watermelon.
Azak jumped off the roof of the building and began to walk slowly towards Rook who had not yet taken notice of him.
“Rune Knight!” Azak yelled at him. There was now silence in the town. It seemed that most everyone was dead, dying, or retreated. Rook turned around to look at Azak. His massive body standing double Azak’s height as he stood up straight. His black armor glistened in the sunlight and a menacing grin appeared across his face.
“Voidmancer!” he said in delight. “Azak! You dog! You bring me all the way out here to retrieve the girl you took. You fucked up.”
“You came all this way to die,” Azak told him. Rook laughed. His voice bellowed throughout the town.
“You don’t seem to understand,” Rook said seriously. “The Dread Lord is through with you. You have caused him way too much trouble. He has given me permission to end you. Permanently.”
Azak stopped. “Alright then, Rune Knight,” he said forming a voidspear and taking a fighting stance. He beckoned him to charge with a gesture of his hand. “Come then. If you are prepared for the Void.”
Rook laughed as he charged. “You stupid little shit!” he yelled.
Azak formed into shadow and charged. He went under and behind Rook and materialized bringing his spear into the back of Rook’s legs. The spear bounced off the armor but the acidic effect it had began to melt the metal. Rook came around quick with his hammer and Azak re-materialized. He came up halfway beside Rook and quickly stabbed him twice in the side again with the same effect.
“You little bastard!” Rook said as he clutched his side. The acid was having an effect and burning his skin.
Azak relentlessly kept up his offensive of materializing and re-materializing and making quick stabs at Rook’s armor. The black armor melted down and now there holes and weak spots throughout it.
“Stop it!” Rook yelled and stomped his foot. The earth shook and Azak was forced to materialize. It took him by surprise and he looked up to see Rook’s hammer coming down on him. He rolled to the left quickly barely dodging the blow. He got up and quickly ran away.
He turned to face Rook with a voidsling in hand. He let loose a voidstone and Rook held up his arms to block it as it exploded. The attack did not kill him but it did damage to his arms. Acid began to eat away at his flesh.
“It’s over, Rook,” Azak told him.
“You little shit!” Rook said. “You don’t understand anything!”
Rook began to yell and the tattoos that were painted all over his body began to glow a bright blue. Then Rook began to grow and soon he had doubled in size and the armor he wore tore off leaving a giant man who was both naked and tattooed in blue runes.
“I cannot be beaten,” Rook said. His voice booming like thunder. “You are only an insect to me!”
Rook charged and Azak threw another stone and it exploded as it hit Rook’s skin. It had no effect on him. He reached Azak and lifted his massive foot.
“Shit,” Azak said and took his shadowform. He moved up and behind Rook as the foot came down. He came up from the shadows with half of his body exposed and attacked with his spear. He hit Rook in the ankle and it had no effect. Rook’s hand came down on him and he evaded the attack.
Azak continued this strategy with the same results every time. Whatever magic was at work rendered Azak’s attacks useless.
“You will get tired soon,” Rook bellowed. “And when you do I will squash you like a bug. Your time is over now, Voidmancer!”
Azak retreated and materialized. He looked at Rook helplessly. He thought about another plan of attack but could come up with nothing.
“It’s over,” Rook said taunting him with his arms spread wide. “Just admit it. Then as a favor, I will end you quick.”
“Hey you!” a voice came from behind Rook. Azak and Rook both looked to see who had said it. It was Aybel. She stood behind Rook a few meters away. Azak felt his heart sink and wondered why she was not with Sayda.
“You’re a cretin!” she cried out.
“What!?” Rook yelled and his voice shook the buildings nearby.
“You hurt people!” she yelled back at him. “I hate you!”
The ground began to shake as Aybel began to scream loudly. Her voice carried over unnaturally as if the earth itself was crying with her.
“What the hell…” Rook said as he looked around confused.
The ground began to calm down as Aybel stopped screaming. She was breathing hard, Azak could see.
Rook laughed. “Nice trick, pipsqueek. Not that it does you any good.”
“Shut up!” she yelled and the air in front of Rook seemed to lash out at him. There was a whipping motion from the wind and a loud crack followed by a flash of light. Azak took to shadowform and rushed to Aybel gliding underneath Rook who was staggered. He came up beside her to see her crying tears of blood.
“You… fucking bitch…” Rook said. Azak turned to face him. Rook had taken a large cut that ran from his face and traveled down the length of his chest. Blood ran profusely from the wound.
“I’ll fucking kill you,” he said. “Fuck the Dread Lord. And fuck you too!”
“I hate you!” Aybel yelled and Azak felt himself knocked away from her with a violent force. Rook charged at her and as he crashed into the force around her he cried out in pain.
“You hurt people!” Aybel cried out. “Now I’m going to kill you!”
Rook yelled in agony. The air around him whipped him over and over in a ruthless effort. He was quickly covered in deep gashes and the tattoos on his body ceased to glow. He returned to his normal size and when the attacks ceased, he stood there dumbfounded looking at Aybel.
Aybel also had blood running down from her eyes and she collapsed. Azak jumped up and ran to her side. Rook fell on his back with a loud thud.
“Aybel!” Azak said. She was unconscious but breathing. He looked at Rook who was also breathing though his breaths were ragged.
Azak formed a voidspear and slowly approached him. He stood over the large man who now was rendered helpless.
“What did…” Rook said and spat up blood.
“It’s over,” Azak told him. “You can’t have her and neither can the Dread Lord.”
“Fuck you!” Rook yelled and Azak shoved his spear into the man’s throat. The acid quickly melted the surrounding tissue and he watched as the life drained out of the once proud Rune Knight.
“Aybel!” Azak heard a voice say. He turned to find Sayda running up the hill. She crouched and cradled Aybel’s small body in her arms.
Daryen and the other men who were with him also came up behind her looking around at the carnage. He approached Azak and looked down at Rook’s lifeless body.
“I got no words,” Daryen told him.
“We still need to get to New Verum,” Azak replied.



















Chapter 21

“We need to invest in a better ride,” Twink complained from the passenger seat. “This hunk o’ junk is way past its expiration date!”
“This is a classic,” Dozer interjected from the back. “With the right parts and the body work we could fix this baby good and proper.”
They were referring to the ‘ 32 Gemeni Lance that Shifty was currently driving. The model was over twenty years old and the gang had put it through hell in the past decade since they claimed ownership to it. The once sleek paint job once shown a bright neon blue had now faded and rusted. It was also riddled with bullet holes and scratches. The hydrogen fuel cell engine had long since needed a tune up and now rattled and moaned when Shifty decided to push the accelerator to the floor, which he had an inclination to do quite often.
“I’m thinking we get one of those Mono Climax,” she said and popped her bubblegum. “Oh yeah, we can put some of those new glitzy spinners and it would look so clean. I’m tellin’ you bruh!”
“I don’t like them,” Dozer said. “The Climax don’t have any kind of muscle. Plus those spinners are shit.”
“You got no sense of style fam!” she said turning around in her chair to face him. “Everyone would be creepin’ us on the road. You got no sense of fashion, Doze.”
“What do you think, Shifty?” Dozer asked. “You want to get a pussy little Climax?”
“I would say if we were to retire the old girl,” he said patting the dashboard, “Then we would need to go with a Prince.”
“Hell yes!” Dozer cheered. “Apok Prince! Now that is power! Fuckin’ v8 biodiesel!”
“Oh, please,” Twink said. “You boys and your muscle cars. You think bigger engines gonna make up for your little dicks.”
“Hate all you want, chica, but I’m telling you! Those things are sick!” Dozer said.
“Whatever,” she replied.
“Get ready,” Shifty said as he pulled into the parking garage. “We are going to walk the rest of the way. We are still five blocks out so we will have to walk the rest of the way.”
“No problem,” Dozer said. “A little walking is good for you.”
“Oh, fuck you,” Twink said. “You got no fucking legs! Me? I gotta haul these fuckin’ droids five blocks. Damn!”
“I’ll carry them for you if you want,” Dozer offered.
“Naw,” she said shaking her head. “Last time you dropped the pack and it took me a week to fix Buzzkill’s rotary propeller.”
“Suit yourself.”
They got out of the car and Shifty opened the trunk. He grabbed his DD2000 sub machine gun. It fired 9x19mm ammunition fed by 44 round magazine. He holstered it on his belt via magnet.
Tank reached in and grabbed his plasma shield and MK7. The MK7 was a sub machine gun similar to the DD2000 though it was more compact and ideal for firing with one hand. It uses 4.6mm x 30 caliber bullets fed by 40 round magazine. His plasma shield was a modified plasma riot shield. When activated, it would form a blue shield that extends the length of Dozer’s body. Unlike a fusion shield, the plasma shield is more focused and acts as a traditional shield. It could only protect where you faced the shield but the strength was much greater than the full body fusion shields.
Lastly, Twink took out her droid backpack. It housed two droids in which she could deploy and control remotely via neural crown. She had one droid that ran on treads named “FYL”. It housed a XX556 minigun and S202 incendiary rocket launcher. It was the bulk of what made up Twink’s “back pack”. The other item that sat on top of it was an aerial drone that she had named “Buzzkill”. It was propelled by four rotary propellers and was equipped with a 9mm SMG that Twink had custom fitted to the drone. All together the backpack weighed almost as much as she did.
“We good to go?” Shifty asked.
“Yeah,” Twink said. “Let’s get this party started.”

They arrived to the block where the Imagine Concert Hall was on. The whole neighborhood was run down and the only people that were around were junkies and gangers.
“Damn, you brought us to a shithole,” Twink said. “This Kaypac must be a classless fuck, aye?”
“He has to stay off the Net,” Shifty said. “That means no access to any databanks. Meaning shitholes are the only place he can call home.”
“Aye, I guess so,” she said.
“Don’t be talkin’ shit about your hometown,” Tank said chuckling.
“Hometown?” she scoffed. “Just ‘cuz I grew up in District twelve doesn’t mean I like the mother fucker. Why you think I ended up sneaking across the wall to hang out with your yellow ass?”
“I thought you just liked the company,” he replied.
“Go ahead and do a sweep,” Shifty told her. “I don’t want any gangers sneaking up on us.”
“Thought you’d never ask,” she said with a pop of her gum. Her neural crowned formed a visor and she pushed a button on her belt. Buzzkill’s lights and propellers lit up and it disengaged from her backpack flying into the air. Her hands formed virtual control pads which looked like gears that sat upon themselves. Depending on how she held her hands and which way she turned them, certain gears would turn indicating different commands for the droid.
Buzzkill flew off on its mission and the rest of the Triad stood and waited. Shifty did a visual sweep and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The gangers that were around either seemed uninterested or intimidated by them. Not that he could blame them, they were only local gangs compared to their military equipped team. If any of them decided to act out of line, they would swiftly be cut down.
“Looks good,” Twink said. Buzzkill returned and set itself on her backpack with a click.
“Okay,” Shifty said. “Let’s move out. Enter the Concert Hall but be ready for anything.”
They moved forward and entered the run down building. There were lights inside but it was very faint. Shifty could hear music in the distance.
“Hell, these fuckers are having a party,” Dozer said.
“Time to crash it,” Shifty said as he moved towards the sound.
The lobby was littered with trash and debris. The Triad moved through slowly with their weapons on the ready. They came upon two large doors and Shifty slowly opened one.
He peeked his head in the door and could see the large concert hall. It was dirty and dimly lit except for flashes of neon lights. He looked to where the sounds and lights were originating to see a fairly large group of people dancing. He quietly entered the room though the music that was being played was so loud he could have yelled as he did so and no one would notice. Twink and Dozer followed closely behind him.
There was a man on the stage who was rapping.
“They want to silence us! But they can’t license us!” his voice boomed through the concert hall. “They want to label us a hindrance! But as far as equity they don’t give any semblance! We walk through this hell with our complacency! They don’t see our generation meta morph into this monstrosity!”
“This music sure is shit,” Twink said over the comm. “His ass needs to stay in hiding if all he is putting out is this garbage.”
Shifty motioned to Dozer and he nodded and began to approach the stage from the far left flank. He looked at Twink and motioned her with his hand and she approached from the far right. Shifty raised his gun and approached through the middle.
He walked through the crowd and most of them paid no attention to him. The few who bothered to look at him saw his gun and backed off. He got up to where the stage was and then hopped on top of it. Kaypac looked at him and stopped his singing.
“The fuck is this?!” he said. The music stopped and everyone began to boo.
“Put your hands behind your head!” Shifty yelled as he pointed the gun at Kaypac.
“The fuck?!” he said with his arms spread in a taunting gesture.
Shifty grabbed his arm and twisted it and Kaypac dropped to his knees.
“Hey, mother fucker! My arm don’t bend that way!” he yelled.
Shifty slung his gun on his back and grabbed Kaypac’s other arm. He zip tied Kaypac’s hands behind his back and everyone began to shout in protest. Shifty pulled out a small medical injector and gave him a shot in his arm.
“Ow! What the fuck you doin’ man?!”
People began to climb on the stage and Dozer and Twink rushed forward. Dozer charged in and knocked two men back into the crowd. The others backed off slowly and hopped off the stage.
“You’re under arrest for conspiracy and crimes against the state,” Shifty told him. “Anything you say is something that I really don’t give a shit about. You have the right to shut the fuck up or get your ass dragged with us kicking and screaming. Choose now.”
“Man, this is some bullshit,” Kaypac said.
“Aw, sounds like he wants Dozer to carry him like a rucksack,” Twink said.
Dozer grabbed him and picked him up to his feet.
“I’d rather you just come quietly, but it’s up to you,” he told Kaypac.
“Man… Whatever…”
Shots rang out from the door. People began to scream and run in every direction. Dozer activated his shield and covered Kaypac. More shots fired and people in the crowd were hit.
“Get off the stage!” Shifty said and they hopped down using the crowd as cover. They ran to the far right of the hall and hid behind the elevated box seats.
“What the fuck is going on now?!” Kaypac yelled.
“Looks like there is more than one bounty on your head,” Shifty said. He peaked around the corner and more shots rang out. Whoever was doing the shooting did so in an erratic manner.
“I can’t get a visual,” Shifty said.
“I gotcha!” Twink said and activated Buzzkill. The droid broke free of her backpack and flew up into the concert hall. “Looks like a few shooters. I count six. They’re wearin’ some black clothes. Robes. Want us to engage?”
“Let’s do it,” he said.
Twink hit another button on her belt and FYL dropped off of her backpack with a loud thud. Its treads quickly came to life as it landed. It rolled out past the corner.
“Switching Buzzkill to VI,” she said as she turned the virtual gears her hands had formed.
“I’m going in too,” Dozer said and began to march around the corner with his shield up and gun up.
“What do you see?” Shifty asked.
“They are still shooting up the crowd,” she said. “Most of them are gone now. Gonna light these fuckers up.”
“Do it,” he said.
The loud whir of FYL’s mini gun rang out through the concert hall. He heard the popping of Dozer’s DD2000 as well.
“We got three of those fuckers!” she said. “Give us a minute. The other three got cover. Gonna get their ass!”
“Careful,” he said. “Stay with Dozer. Don’t let him get flanked. We don’t know if they have any help.”
“I got this,” she said. The sound of FYL’s incendiary rockets were heard.
“Direct hit!” she exclaimed. “Got two of them around the corner! Ha!”
Shifty looked at Kaypac who stood there impatiently. There was a beeping coming from a virtual panel of Twink’s.
“Shit,” she said. “We got two more bogies! Aw, what the fuck!”
“What is it?” he asked.
“One of them is a machinist,” she said. “He’s got a beast of a droid!”
There was a loud and piercing howl and a large projectile tore a big hole in the stage.
“Dozer! Get your ass back here!” Twink cried. There was another howl and shrapnel flew from the stage again. “He’s got him pinned down!”
Shifty peeked around the corner. He could see the droid she was talking about. It was a reverse joint bipedal combat droid. It had a large rail gun as its primary weapon. He did a quick scan of the room and saw Dozer crouched down behind the seats. The droid fired another rail that blew a large swath through the seats almost hitting him. FYL was around further to left also behind some seats.
“Hold your position,” Shifty said as he came back around the corner. “I’m going to do a back hack.”
“Aye, well hurry up will ya?” she said. “I lost visual on the other bogies. They are probably flanking out ass!”
Shifty activated his neural crown and did a soft dive into the Net. He did a quick search of the proximity of any devices currently being accessed by neural devices. His filter automatically negated Twink’s droids. He found the battle droid and quickly accessed it only to be met with the expected firewall. He prompted his quarks to disassemble it and they began to attack it with worms and other infections.
Another shot rang out and Twink screamed.
“Hurry the fuck up, Shifty!” she screamed. “Dozer can’t take much more of this!”
“Almost got it…” Shifty said. Another shot.
“Shifty!”
“Almost…” Another shot. “Got it!”
He took control of the droid and was now able to see from its eyes. He looked around the room and saw one of the men right above where they were standing. He shot a rail in his direction but it was to late. The man dropped down on top of them. Shifty severed his link from the droid and saw the man grab Kaypac and run. Shifty pulled up his gun but was unable to get a clean shot off before the two of them rounded the other corner.
“Shit!” Shifty said as he gave chase. The quickness in which the man moved meant he was either a meta human or was operating on stim drugs.
Shifty rounded the corner in which they had escaped. They had already hit the exit and he began to chase them.
“Shifty come back!” Twink said over the comm. “Dozer’s been hit!”
“Shit,” Shifty said as he stopped mid step. He ran back into the concert hall to find Twink standing over Dozer who was sitting on the floor nursing a wound in his side.
“How bad is it?” Shifty asked.
“It’s nothing,” Dozer said. “Just took a piece of debris in the side.”
“Fuck me! It ain’t nothin’!” Twink snapped. “You could have been killed, bruh! Now sit still and let me seal the wound with my biospray.”
“They got away, huh?” Dozer asked.
“Afraid so,” Shifty said.
“So that’s it?” Dozer said. “Mission failed. We go back to being broke nursing our wounds.”
“Not necessarily,”Shifty replied. “I managed to inject a tracker into Kaypac when I cuffed him. So we can follow them, no problem. I also got a back hack on that droid. Meaning I have access to all his memories and data. His machinist had to leave some impressions from his own neural crown while he was jacked in. Give me some time to analyze that and then we can go get our boy, Kaypac.”
“Sounds good!” Dozer said with a smile.
“Too bad you had to lose control of that droid,” Twink said as she slowly pulled the wood out of Dozer’s side. “I would have liked to adopt that fucker.”
“There will be a next time,” Shifty said. “And we’ll be ready when that happens.”










Chapter 22

The large ship slowly came into view as it made its approach from the horizon towards the docks of Armagetown. Azak watched it in anticipation. Standing next to him were Sayda and Aybel.
“Do you think they are friendly?” Aybel asked.
“As long as we pay them,” Azak replied. “The Argonaughts are known to be shrewd though in regards to trade, they can be very reasonable. Mercantilism is the basis of their society, aside from sailing, of course.”
“We have more than enough money from the horn and the windsail, right?” Sayda asked.
“Yes, more than enough,” Azak said.
Daryen walked up from behind them and stood next to Azak.
“Looks like your ride showed up just in time,” he said.
“Indeed,” Azak replied. “I hope the townspeople are not to upset with us over what happened.”
“Are you kidding me?” Daryen laughed. “They are thankful. It got rid of Solomon and his crew. There were a few townspeople who died, but they had no family and it could have been a lot worse.”
“That is good to hear,” Azak said. “It was not our wish to involve the town in our troubles. What will you do now?”
“Well, I am to be mayor now if you can believe it,” Daryen said with a big grin. “The people would not let me say no. So we are going to turn this place into a trading town. A true trading town. We got pigs and the like to make biofuel. Pretty soon word will have spread about what happened here and people will come to trade.”
“I wish you the best.”
“Aye,” Daryen said scratching his head. “Same to you, Azak of the Arid Plains. Or whatever the hell you are.” He laughed.
The boat pulled up beside them. It seemed massive compared to other vessels that Azak had encountered. The idea that something that big made of metal could sail the open seas was mind boggling to him. When it stopped, a large platform extended from the deck of the ship and rested on the dock. There were various men on board performing various tasks and they paid little heed to Azak and the others on the dock.
A man with a black trench coat and a bald head with a black goatee walked down the ramp. His clothes were very clean and fashionable for a sailor, Azak thought. The look of the man’s face seemed to be that of someone with experience of hardships.
“Greetings,” Daryen said. “My name is Daryen. I am the new mayor of Armagetown.”
“What happened to Solomon?” the man asked as he stepped aboard the dock.
“We were attacked by marauders the day before yesterday,” Daryen explained. “Solomon as well as some other townspeople were killed.”
“I see,” the man said. “My condolences. Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Rowan Keetes. I am captain of this vessel. It is known as the Scorn.”
“It looks to be a mighty ship,” Daryen said. “Would you wish to come with me to the Town Hall? I am sure there is much we have to discuss.”
“Indeed,” Captain Keetes replied.

After much discussion, Daryen and Captain Keetes worked out a new trading schedule in order for the town to be able to recover from the change in leadership. There was some minor trade deals as a show of respect as to not waste the Scorn’s time in coming to this part of the world. Daryen also booked passage for Azak and his companions aboard the Scorn. It was by sheer luck or perhaps fate that the Scorn’s next destination was New Verum.
After a feast, Captain Keetes led Azak and the others aboard the Scorn. The ship was very big and had many decks from what Azak could tell. They were led to the crew quarters and given their own room.
“I would advise you to steer clear of the crews duties,” Captain Keetes said. “None of my men will give you any problems I can assure you. If there is any type of intrusion on unauthorized decks, however, you will be confined to quarters.”
They had no belongings and so settling into the new room was a fairly quick transition. There were four beds and Aybel laid on one of them, happy to not have to sleep on the deck floor of the wind sail any longer. Sayda merely sat on hers and gazed out of the window.
“After this, we will be outside of the Dread Lord’s influence,” she said.
“More than likely,” Azak said. “Do not underestimate his resolve though. There is no telling the lengths he will go to get the girl.”
Aybel looked at him looking hurt at being referred to as “the girl”.
“Well, I don’t blame him,” Sayda said. “Though after what she did to that Rune Knight, I bet he will think twice before messing with her.”
The two girls laughed. Azak smiled though it was a meek effort. He felt that something awaited them in New Verum even worse than the Dread Lord. The Spider Queen did not specify what exactly they would find, only that Azak was to lead the girl there in order to find sanctuary. Thinking about the machinations of demons were something that Azak hated contemplating and thought it would drive him mad at times. He now realized after the battle for Armagetown that Aybel was something special. Her powers would be sought out by many who discovered her capabilities.
As far as the extent of her capabilities, Azak thought it best not to think to hard on that. So far she had only exceeded any expectations he might have. Whatever magic or powers she had seemed to be of a cognitive origin. It did not operate in the way of traditional magic or even unique magic like the Void. He thought it best to just let time be the judge on what and how she should use her abilities.

When the night fell, the ship was quiet except for the low hum of the engines. Azak lay on his bed looking up at the ceiling. Since he had become undead, his body no longer needed sleep. This made for long and boring nights. He usually reminisced about his wife or the hunt. Lately, he found it hard to visual her face for some reason. He could remember her smell but her face was becoming more of a vague idea than an image.
There were nights he wished he could cry himself to sleep or even just to cry would be a relief. His heart, he thought, had grown as cold as the rest of his body. He felt rage more than anything. The wrath that was stored in his chest felt like it would explode at any moment.
“Isante, my love…” he whispered to himself.
Sayda got up from her bed. He looked over at her curiously as she slowly approached his bed.
“I didn’t mean to wake you,” he said sitting up.
“Shhh,” she said putting her finger on his lips. She crawled into bed with him. “Just lay down.”
Slowly, he laid back as she gently pushed his shoulder down. She lay beside him and stared into his eyes.
“Isante was your lover?” she asked. Her voice was a whisper and could barely be heard.
“She was my wife,” he said. “She was pregnant with my child when she died.”
“How did she die?”
“Sol of the Mag Mar killed her.”
“I cannot replace your wife,” she said. “I would not dare to try but… I can help to ease the pain you feel.”
“It’s okay,” he said. “I am fine really…”
She leaned into him and kissed him softly. Their lips locked for many long moments until she pulled away.
“You saved me…” she said. “You have given me hope and…”
“You don’t need to do this,” he said.
“I love you. I don’t expect you to love me back. I know your heart belongs to Isante. I want to share your pain though. Won’t you let me?”
He said nothing. She leaned in and kissed him again. This time it was a deeper kiss and her hand went up his shirt, rubbing his chest. Her hand stopped on the corrupted wound that he bore from the aether sword. She pulled up his shirt and began to kiss the wound.
He sat looking up at the ceiling as he felt her warm lips press against his body. Her hand rubbed his stomach wound. He instinctively put his hand on hers. She kissed his lips again.
“I love you, Azak of the Arid Plains,” she said.
She reached down into his pants and grabbed him. Her warm hand holding him as his cold body pulsed.
“You’re so warm,” he said. “I am a cold shell.”
“I can be warm for both of us,” she said.
“We will wake up Aybel,” he said.
“She is a deep sleeper.”
She pulled his pants down and began to suck him. He held back a moan and instead pressed his hands hard into the bed. His eyes went from the ceiling to the back of his skull as he felt the warmness of her mouth.
She sat up and took off her shirt exposing her breasts.
“You are so beautiful,” he said as he felt her round bosom. Her delicate features were more pronounced than that of a human. It was no wonder that the Dread Lord decided to keep the Drydalis around.
She leaned forward and placed her nipple in his mouth. He began to suck and lick at her. His hands gently squeezing the breast.
She leaned back and slid her pants off. Azak thought of protesting but the words did not come out. She took his hand and placed it on the wetness between her thighs. Slowly, she guided him inside her.
Her hands glided up and down his chest and stomach as she slowly swayed her hips. Azak placed his hands on her soft hips and sat up going deeper into her. She placed her hand on his chin and kissed him deeply.
“I am yours, Azak of the Arid Plains. Now and forever.”
She began to sway harder and faster. It was not long until he did the same. He squeezed her back and then her buttocks. She kissed him hard. He pushed as she pulled away and it became a fast rhythm. The pressure increased and so did her momentum. He could feel her squeezing him as she glided. She squeezed and squeezed until finally he exploded inside her.
Her hips slowed down and stopped. His muscles tensed up and then relaxed. She looked into his eyes and he in hers.
“Thank you for that,” she said.
Slowly, she pulled back from him. She put her clothes back on and so did he. She laid beside him with her arm draped over his chest and her head on his shoulder.
He stared back up at the ceiling. This time, the wrath that he felt bottled up inside, had become calm and he smiled for the first time in a long time.





























Chapter 23

She opened her eyes and the bright light nearly blinded her. She blinked repeatedly trying to get a grasp on what was going on. Where was she? How long had she been there? What happened?
“Zozo, you’re awake!” a familiar voice said.
“What… happened…” she managed to say.
“You were injured,” the voice said. “You took a bad bump to the head. You’re skull was fractured and your brain was bruised.”
She vaguely remembered being at the Cathedral and the battle with the dragoons. It seemed like a dream now. She remembered Wido and his rampage. She remembered his transformation.
“The dragoons?” she asked.
“More than half of them were killed,” the voice said. She recognized his voice now. It was Kit.
“It’s my fault,” she whispered. “I led them there. I had no idea… of what Wido was.”
“Don’t talk like that,” Kit said. “They are soldiers and knew the risks.”
“Did Wido get away?” she asked.
“They found no one at the scene besides you and various dead bodies,” he said. “I came here as soon as I got the notification you had been injured. They only told me a bit of what happened. Frankly, I don’t understand what you were doing there in the first place.”
“It’s fine,” she said as she looked up at the ceiling. “Where is my father? I need to speak with him.”
“He will be here shortly, as well as Administrator Walker and Agent Vance. They all seemed very adamant to speak to you.”
“Can you inform them that I am awake?”
“Certainly,” he said as he got up and left.

It took around an hour for the three men to reach the hospital Zoe was located in. Her head pounded and the doctor had given her an injection to calm the pain. The dullness of her headache remained and the world seemed foggy. The three men entered her room.
“Zoe,” her father said, “how are you feeling?”
“Like I got hit by a train,” she said. “Forget about that though, we need to talk.”
“Certainly.”
“Archbishop Wido was the one who attacked us,” she said. “He was different though, transformed into some kind of beast.”
“What kind of beast?” her father asked.
“Like a… demon…” she said. “He had grown in height and had wings… He had some kind of power… It ripped the dragoons to shreds in less than a minute. He could have killed me but for whatever reason he let me go.”
“Are you certain of this?” he asked. “A beast with wings? It sounds rather far fetched.”
“I know what I saw.” she said. “Where is my neural crown? It should have recorded everything.”
“You’re neural crown was broken when you hit your head,” Vance told her. “I am currently building you another one with the same specifications.”
“What about the other dragoons?” she asked. “They had crowns.”
“Every dragoon that was sent in the sanctuary with you died,” the general told her solemnly. “All of their neural crowns were missing when we found them. Or what was left of them rather.”
“Our weapons were useless against it,” she said. “We need to find out what he has become and how to beat him.”
“We will,” he replied. “You need your rest if you are to recover.”
“Speaking of which…” Administrator Walker said, “I hate to do this to you, Zoe, but I have to suspend you from the case until the doctor gives you the go ahead.”
“You can’t do that!” she said sitting up.
“I’m afraid my hands are tied,” he said. “This order comes from the Prime Director. He doesn’t want anything to happen to you seeing as how you are our top agent. He knows that all of our progress has been due to your efforts and he has deemed you too valuable of an asset to lose.”
“We have to find out what the Legion is up to,” she said. “And we have to find a cure for the techno virus. How long do we have until people start dying?”
“According to the data,” her father said, “We have a little over a week until people start dying. The children will be the first to go due to their weaker immune systems.”
“A little over a week…” she whispered. That meant she had been in a coma for at least five days. She had wasted too much time.
“Let us give her some time to rest,” her father said and the men nodded and began to head out.
“Vance,” she said as he started to leave. “Stay for a minute, please.”
“What’s up?” he asked after the other men were gone.
“I need you to bring me the neural crown as soon as it’s finished,” she told him.
“I figured,” he said. “I got about a day’s worth of work left on it. I’ll go get started on it right now and try to get it done in half that. You need to take it easy though. That bruise on your brain is going to have trouble healing if you push yourself too hard in a dive.”
“Let me worry about that.”
“Sure, thing.” he said. “There is something else. I hired a team to find Kaypac. Long story short somebody got the jump on them and they lost him. They managed to get a tracker on him though and are heading to the location to scope it out. I told them to just scout it out and don’t try to be heroes. This may lead us to the Legion’s base of operations.”
“Great,” she said. “Anything else?”
“The guy that Eva brought in… one of the Legion that jumped her in that alley, we did some tests on him, Zoe. His brain got fried. It was hit by some kind of neural virus. I haven’t seen anything like this. I attached the slave crown to him and his memories are all jumbled up but…”
“What?”
“He encountered our friend on the Net… the one who got the jump on us in the quantum stream. That bad ass fucker that treated us like we were second rate hackers. I think he is some kind of safeguard against the Network. Maybe he glitched out or something. The program is old and way more sophisticated than anything we have ever came up with.”
“This just keeps getting better and better.”
“When you jump you need to be careful,” he said. “Last time his buddy showed up to save us. If it hadn’t, well… we would be both be brain fried.”
“Noted,” she said. “In the meantime you got work to do.”

She ended up falling asleep, thanks mostly to the medication. Later that night, she woke up. The hospital was quiet and she quickly became restless. She decided to get up from her bed and walk outside.
Kit was sitting in a chair outside of the room.
“Zozo!” he said. “You’re awake! What are you doing? You should be resting.”
“I am tired of being cramped in that room,” she said. “I am going to walk the hall and stretch my legs.”
“That is out of the question!” he said. “You need your rest if you are going to heal!”
“Relax, mother,” she said. “I am not going far.”
“But, Zozo! You are in a hospital gown! You’re butt is hanging out! It’s practically indecent!”
“I’m fine,” she said patting him on the head. “Just wait here. You’ll do that right?”
“Fine,” he said with a sigh.
She walked down the hall slowly, the cold floor tingling her bare feet. There was no one in the hall except the occasional nurse. They paid her little mind as they did their rounds.
“Nothing much to see, I guess,” she said to herself feeling somewhat disappointed.
“Is that you, Alex?” she heard a voice say. “Alex? Don’t be shy now!”
The voice was coming from a nearby room. Her curiosity got the best of her and she walked in.
“You’re not Alex,” the voice said. It was an elderly woman. She was laying in bed with an IV and heart monitor attached to her.
“I am afraid not,” Zoe said. “I am sorry to disturb you.”
“That’s alright,” the woman said. “Feel free to stay a bit. If you don’t mind, that is. It’s awfully boring here. Nothing to do but stare at the wall. I’ve already counted all the flowers on the wallpaper nearly two dozen times.”
Zoe smiled. “Yes, it is quite a boring place. What is your name, ma’am?”
“Olivia, and yours dear?”
“Zoe.”
“Well, come in, come in!” Olivia said motioning her. “Don’t just stand at the door. Come have a seat.”
Zoe walked over to the chair next to the bed and sat down.
“Look at you,” Olivia said, “You’re a beauty if I ever saw one. And they have you in that hospital gown with your butt hanging out for the world to see! It’s indecent if you ask me!”
Zoe smiled again. “It’s quite alright. I am used to people staring at me.”
“Is that so? Well, as for me, I never like making a splash. The less people pay mind to me the better. Of course, I say that now, but if only I made more friends before I was bed ridden then I might have the occasional visitor.”
“You don’t have family?”
“Oh, I did at one point,” Olivia said with a smile. “I had a husband and a son. They are both gone now. Dead.”
“I’m sorry,” Zoe said.
“Why are you sorry? It’s not your fault. It took me a long time, but I am finally over it. I still miss them something awful. I guess those kinds of feelings never leave us though. Not while we still breathe anyways.”
Zoe smiled again, though more meekly this time.
“So what about you, dear? What brings you to this fine institution?”
“Well, I took a bump to the head,” Zoe said. “It was work related. I took a nasty fall and woke up here.”
“And what is it you do dear?” Olivia asked.
“I work for the government.”
“Oh, how awful!”
“Why is that awful?”
“Well, I never did like the government,” Olivia said. “They are always treating us Residents shamefully.”
“I see,” Zoe said. “Why are you here?”
“I’m dying,” Olivia said. “I have cancer. It is of the lungs. Malignant. Comes from living in the industrial district. All that smog is so heavy there.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Why do you keep apologizing? Are you the one running the factories? Or maybe your job in the government requires you to make sure there is smog in the air?”
Zoe smiled again. She liked this woman’s up front attitude. “No. I guess not.”
“There is plenty of blame to go around, if we take the time to waste it,” Olivia said. “My husband and son died in the Turf Wars, for example. Ian, that’s my son, he got caught up in one of those gangs in that time. Hell, I think everyone had a son that was in those days. He wasn’t but fifteen mind you. Well, Joseph, that’s my husband, he wouldn’t have it. One day he got his pistol and took a visit to their hideout. Do you know what happened next?”
“No.”
“There was a police raid at that very moment! That is fate or the divine Hand of the One God. Either way it happened and both my son and my husband were taken from me. It took many years and many tears for me to get over that.”
“I’m…” Zoe began but decided not to finish the sentence.
Olivia looked at her approvingly. “So, yes, I blamed the government after that for years.”
“The government?” Zoe asked confused. “Why not the gangers?”
“The gangers were nothing,” Olivia said. “Sure, they were bad news. That is just life in New Verum. The government holds the power though. If they wanted to, they could have done something to make peace with the gangers. Instead they wanted to act tough. What happened as a result? They shoot first and ask questions later. It’s a tragedy.”
“I see,” Zoe said softly. She found herself agreeing with the woman’s logic.
“What’s done is done,” Olivia said. “Now the One God calls me and soon I will cross over to the other side. Who knows? Maybe I will see both husband and son! Wouldn’t that be something!”
“I hope so,” Zoe said. “I need to go now. My head is spinning. Depending on how long they keep me here… I will return.”
“Oh, that’s fine, dear. You do what you have to do. Pay no mind to me.”
“I enjoyed this talk,” Zoe said and headed back to her room.












































Chapter 24

“I need action, not more speculation!” Prime Director Baxter said as he slammed his fist on his desk.
“My people are doing the best they can,” Administrator Walker replied. “The fact of the matter is, the Legion are more capable than any of us originally believed. We have made real headway in the past month. However, the time table due to this technovirus do not give us the time we need to do thorough investigative procedures. With my best agent out of the field, it has slowed progress dramatically.”
He seems quite calm delivering this news, General Renvar thought. This was everything that Director Baxter did not want to hear. Glossing over it did not help him though.
“The time table you are working on has shifted once again, or have you forgotten?” the Prime Director asked. “We have had our first fatality of this technovirus. Jay Howard. He is four years old, damnit!”
Prime Director Baxter put his head in his hands. He stayed like that for a moment and then composed himself.
“We need answers, gentlemen,” he said finally. “What can you give me that we can work with?”
“We are one step closer to finding a cure,” the man named Luca Foster said. He was the chief scientist that worked for the Pharmaceutical Research Conglomerate. “I am sure if we had another month… or two… we could come up with a vaccine and maybe even an anti-virus to combat the Hyperpox.”
The Hyperpox was the name they had given the technovirus. General Renvar did not know the specific details to how the virus attacked its host, but he did know that the victim would become covered in boils and pus-filled pimples. The first week the rash would occur as well as nausea and dysentery. Blindness would occur within two weeks of contracting the virus. Seizures and high fever within the third week, followed by paralysis and organ failure in the fourth week.
“The people are losing faith in the government,” Director Baxter said. “I don’t blame them. How can we expect them to trust us when we cannot protect our most vulnerable?”
“If I may make a suggestion,” Baron Vlad said, “why not give the Legion what they want?”
“Excuse me?” Director Baxter asked. General Renvar was also taken aback by the suggestion.
“They want us to leave New Verum,” Baron Vlad explained. “We can just leave. I don’t really see any other option.”
“Leave?” Director Baxter asked as if he did not understand the meaning of the word. “And go where pray tell? Into the Wastelands to wander like some nomadic tribe? What the hell are you thinking Baron Vlad?”
“I am just saying that it could buy us some time. And perhaps, if we are lucky, they will give us the antidote.”
“Out of the question!” Director Baxter said.
“If it is our course to stay then,” Baron Vlad said, “It may be prudent to set up contingency for what is to come if the people at the Super Dome never find a cure.”
A feeling of dread entered the room at the thought. No one had stopped to really consider this.
“If I may say, sir,” General Renvar spoke up, “If what Baron Vlad speaks up were to actually take place, there would certainly be riots as well as other civil unrest. However, I am confident in the military’s ability to contain such an occurrence if it came to that.”
“Martial law,” Director Baxter said. “That’s what they want. That’s what the Legion are after.”
“To what end?” the general replied. “I see no tactical advantage of the Legion in taking this course of action.”
“From an ideological standpoint it makes perfect sense,” Baron Vlad said. “The Legion have had one consistency with every action they have taken and that is undermining the people’s confidence in the Federal Government. If we were to declare martial law, it would increase that animosity ten fold. Perhaps, even more, seeing as how we would have allowed the death of two hundred thousand souls.” 
“What we need,” Baron Armand said, “us to make an example. We should execute members of the Legion. Publicly.”
General Renvar winced. He never did like Baron Armand. He ruled his district with an iron fist. His ruthless tactics in the Turf Wars only served to undermine any sort of peace agreements with the local gangs. And from what Zoe had told him, he was likely to be involved in the Legion at some level. It was highly sensitive information that he would love to share with the Prime Director but he could not until they had some kind of hard evidence to pin on him.
“We only have one prisoner taken by the Legion,” Administrator Walker said. “He is too valuable to be executed in some kind of public spectacle.”
“It doesn’t have to be the Legion,” Baron Armand said. “The people just need to think that it is.”
“What are you suggesting?” Director Baxter asked.
“What I am suggesting, sir, is that we put twelve prisoners on display and execute them. We tell the media that they are involved in the attack on the Super Dome. We tell them they are Legion. Then we send a message by shooting them in the head for the world to see. It will put the population in check when they see that we are taking extreme measures to deal with this crisis.”
“That is absurd,” General Renvar said. “You want to execute innocent men for the sake of maintaining public order on some half cocked theory?”
“Hardly innocent,” Baron Armand replied, “I can give you twelve men from my district who we have rounded up for gang violence and other high crimes. Trust me when I say that the media has not publicized who they are. Unlike the rest of you, I do not let the people dictate how I run my district.”
“What do you think?” Director Baxter asked looking at Baron Vlad.
“Ethically, it is preposterous,” Baron Vlad said. “Politically… It might help with the damage control.”
“This is absurd!” General Renvar exclaimed.
“Do you have another option?” Director Baxter asked. “I don’t like it anymore than you but we have to do something. We cannot allow the Legion to dictate our every reaction. We have to take the offensive!”
General Martuk said nothing. He put his hands behind his back and kept his face as stoic as he could maintain. Director Baxter seemed to take it as surrender.
“See to the preparations,” Director Baxter said looking at Baron Armand. “How soon can we do this?”
“It can be done tonight, sir,” the Baron said with a stone face.
“See to it. Now, for the rest of you, I want results! Get out there and find us a way out of this mess before we have to take anymore of these drastic measures!”
General Martuk was the first to leave. His face was flushed and his breathing heavy. He wanted to run Baron Armand down and punch him in his stoic face. He would not, of course. He had long since learned to control his emotions. Instead, he would return to doing what he knew best, and that was leading his men in the protection of New Verum.
To hell with the politicians, he thought. And to hell with Baron Armand.




































Chapter 25

It had been two days since the Triad’s encounter at the Imagine Concert Hall. The team had managed to lose Kaypac in the confusion of battle. Luckily, Shifty had injected the technorapper with a nanotracker. They knew exactly where he was, there was just one problem. The location of where he was being held was in the Old City.
The Old City was on the outskirts of New Verum in the abandoned ruins. Apparently, when they built New Verum almost two hundred years ago, they utilized the city ruins that were here before. The old Verum was much bigger than the new, however, and the present city only utilized a quarter of the megapolis of the older one. So, as a result, the Old City sat unclaimed and thus it was a dangerous and contested territory.
Raiders and bandits mostly wandered the ruins vying for the different zones and the old technology they held. The constant fighting was occasionally halted by the incursions of the Federal Government who also wanted the technology for themselves. This was mainly done by the Rangers, a group of elite soldiers who specialized in fighting outside of the city.
The Triad had reached the outer wall to District Thirteen. What stood before them was a thirty meter tall metal barrier. It had various thick steel plates that reinforced the concrete center. The pillars that acted as the support jutted out towards them every fifty meters.
“So you sure about this tunnel?” Shifty asked as he looked at the wall.
“Of course I am sure,” the old orkin said. His name was Norl and he was nearly eighty years old. Despite his age he moved around with tremendous stride. “I come here every month to trade with raiders. A group known as the Lost Souls. Freaky bunch. They wear tattoos from head to toe that make them look like skeletons. They got a code though. They always pay what they owe. Some kind of cult belief they have. It was explained to me that in the next life they will be rewarded three times over what they reap here in this life. Not sure how all that raiding and killing fits in. I never ask these kinds of questions.”
“No worries,” Tank said as he slapped Norl on the back. “We trust you! And we will keep your secret. You got nothing to worry about.”
“Just make it back in one piece,” Norl replied. “I want the other half of my money and I won’t be getting it if you end up dead.”
“No prob,” Twink said with a pop of her gum. “Raiders are the Triad’s bread and butter. We eat them up like hotcakes.”
“Ha!” said Narl. “Well, you got balls. I’ll give you that.”
“And we know how to use them,” Twink said.
“Yes. You always did, Twink,” Narl said with a scratch of his head. “Hell, I remember the first time I saw you here in District Thirteen. Running around with this bonehead. You got into a fight with an orkin over twice your size.”
“Yeah,” she said. “I beat his ass too.”
“With my help,” Tank chimed in.
“She jumped up this high,” Norl said holding his hand up to his chest, “and punched that orkin right in the nose. The look he gave was the damndest thing I ever saw.”
“I’d love to stay and reminisce,” Shifty said. “We have a job to do. When we get back the drinks are on me.”
“Oh, alright!” Norl said. He walked over to a dumpster and pushed it out of the way. There was a thick sheet of metal on the ground and Norl picked up one side of it and dragged it. It revealed a hole in the ground with a ladder.
“It goes down nine meters,” Norl said sounding proud. “Dug it myself. Back in the Turf Wars. Don’t worry though. I replace the supports every year or so. Not that it is needed mind you. You can never be to careful, however.”
“Alright,” Shifty said. “Let’s go.”
The team climbed down the ladder into the dark tunnel. Shifty lit a flare instead of turning on his night vision for the team’s benefit. The tunnel was around fifteen meters. The wall itself was twelve meters thick. They climbed up and out of the tunnel and into the ruins of the Old City.
The Old City was nothing but ruins and debris. The tall skyscrapers that littered the landscape sat in desolation as they hovered over the destruction scattered below them. Frames of cars and stores filled the streets. The concrete ground beneath them was shattered as if a giant earthquake had sundered it.
“Holy shit, bruh,” Twink said as she looked on the destruction. “I’ve only seen it from the top of the wall. Being down here really gives you a perspective, aye?”
“Just stay alert,” Shifty said. “Last thing we need is to bring attention to ourselves.”
The group started down the street. Shifty brought up his neural map and his visor acted as a compass showing him the direction of Kaypac.
“He is about three kilometers that way,” he said. “Maybe a little more…”
“Let’s get to it,” Tank said as they continued walking.
The air smelled stale here. Instead of the smog that always hovered in New Verum, this felt like an old room that had been sealed away for years until someone finally decided to open it. The wind began to blow softly though the smell remained.
“I’m going to need a long bath after this,” Twink said. “This is like being in your grandmother’s ass.”
“Don’t talk about my grandmother!” Tank said. “You know I hate that.”
“You didn’t even know her,” she replied. “Don’t be so sensitive.”
“Knowing her has nothing to do with it,” he said. “It is about respect. She is long dead and you should honor that.”
“Honor that,” she mocked. “When did you start giving a shit about honor?”
“I’ve always cared about honor. I may not adhere to many orkin traditions but honor is different. It is what defines us as a race.”
“Right… So what about all those pornos you got stashed under your bed?” she asked. “I hear you wankin’ it at night. How is that honorable? I am a young lady and I do not need that mental image!”
“What are you talking about!?” he asked. “I do not… wank it!”
“Be quiet,” Shifty said as he raised a hand. “We are being watched.”
“The fuck? You serious?” she asked.
“Afraid so,” he said. He turned on his neural scanner and did an infrared scan. “About twenty of them up in that building in front of us. I am pretty sure they saw us coming from a half a kilometer away.”
“Let’s just go around them,” Tank said.
“I don’t think that’s possible,” he told him. “We need to figure out if they want a fight or not.”
“How do you propose we do that?” Twink asked.
“Wait here,” Shifty said as he began to walk towards the building. He held up his hands as he made his way, hoping to show them he meant no hostility.
A man emerged from the building. He had tattoos from head to toe. His face was painted to look like a skull except for the top of his head which was made to look as if his brain was exposed. All he wore for clothing was a pair of black pants and boots. He had a rifle in hand though it was not pointed at Shifty.
“Are you one of the Lost Souls?” Shifty asked.
“Who wants to know?” the man asked as he stopped within a meter of him.
“My name is Shifty. This is my team. We are tracking a man named Kaypac. He was taken captive.”
“Well, you must either be crazy or stupid to come all the way out here,” the man said. “This here is Lost Soul territory. Up ahead is the New God Nation land. They are bad news. You won’t make it out of there alive if you go.”
“We don’t have much of a choice, I’m afraid.” Shifty said. “Am I to assume you are going to give me safe passage through your territory?”
“Do I come off as that generous?” the man asked. “The truth is you and your group look to be capable fighters. Which is what we are in need of.”
“We aren’t interested in joining your raiding party, if that is what you are getting at.”
“I am talking about a temporary alliance,” the man said. “The New God Nation have been pushing us further back against the wall and our numbers are dwindling. We need to go on the offensive. That is where you come in.”
“I see,” Shifty said scratching his chin. “Alright. I don’t see any other way around this. I think it may benefit both of us so consider it a deal.”
“Good. My name is Penance. What’s yours?”
“Shifty. My group is the Triad. It’s always a pleasure to meet a friendly face.”




















Chapter 26

The ship rocked back and forth in a rhythmic motion. Azak and the girls were up on deck and looking at the water. Aybel, in particular, was enjoying the rocking and watching the ocean. She had never seen the ocean, let alone been in the middle of it.
“I didn’t know so much water even existed,” she said at one point.
“They don’t teach you these things in your tribe?” Azak had asked.
“No way,” she had replied. “They don’t teach girls anything except how to cook and sew. A good girl only does what she is told, my papa would tell me.”
Azak wondered how a tribe could survive in the Wastes like that. In the Eltiyah tribe women were discouraged from hunting, true, but they were taught how to shoot a bow from a very early age. Education was valued among both sexes from an early age also. He had never really thought much on how other tribes raised their own children. It had not even occurred to him they would even do things differently than his own.
“How are you enjoying the open sea?” Captain Keetes asked as he joined them beside the railing.
“I love it!” Aybel said. “It’s so pretty!”
“Indeed it is!” the Captain replied. He inhaled deeply. “The air is so pure out here. Unlike the Wastelands where everything is so dirty. And just wait until we get to New Verum. The smog there is unbearable.”
“What is smog?” Azak asked.
“You don’t know what smog is? Well, not at all surprising now that I think about it. Well, smog is the smoke that comes from the factories and machines. It rests in the air and creates a fog. Very nasty stuff.”
“What’s a factory?” Aybel asked.
“Well… it’s… uh… like a place where they build things,” Captain Keetes explained.
“How does this boat swim?” she asked.
“Well… uh…” he began as he scratched his head.
“Aybel, I’m sure the Captain is a busy man and has better things to do than answer all of our questions,” Sayda said.
“Oh, I’m sorry, Captain Keetes,” she said as she bowed.
“That’s quite alright, girl,” he said with a smile. “Truth is, I do need to get back to the bridge. A storm or anything can creep on you if you aren’t vigilant.”
“Thank you, Captain Keetes,” Azak told him.
The Captain walked off and the rest of them stared at the waves. Aybel continued to ask questions, most to which Azak did not know the answers.
Sayda put her arms around Azak. He tensed up slightly, as he still was not used to such affection, but he welcomed it nonetheless. Aybel ignored the public display of closeness, to Azak’s relief.
“Are there things alive in there?” she asked.
“Yes,” Sayda said. “They are called fish.”
“Fish?” Aybel said as the word rolled off her tongue. “What do they look like?”
“They have scales and make weird faces like this,” Azak said and did his best fish impersonation. The girls laughed at him.
“You look so stupid!” Aybel yelled.
“That’s not nice,” Azak replied with a smiled.
“She does have a point though,” Sayda said. “It looked quite stupid.”
“Well… maybe a little,” Azak admitted.
“So if fish live in there? How do they breathe?” Aybel asked continuing her query.
“They have gills,” Azak said. He noticed the answer was not sufficient to fill her curiosity. “They breathe water.”
“That’s weird. What do they eat?”
“Other fish probably,” he said shrugging. “This is actually my first time seeing the ocean as well. What about you Sayda?”
“When I was a girl, my father took me to the ocean once,” she said. “That was over a hundred years ago, so my memory is a little fuzzy.”
“Was the world so dirty then too?” Aybel asked. “One hundred years ago?”
“Indeed it was,” Sayda told her. “It was different though. You did not see as many people. They were still around but back then people tended to keep to themselves more. At least, where the Drydalis lived. We went a whole decade one time without having any visitors.”
She had rested her head on Azak’s shoulder and put her hands around his waste. He put one of his hands on hers.
“If I remember my history correctly,” he said, “the Eltiyah had just crossed the Expanse around that time. They had been wandering for years before they came across the Arid Plains in search of good land to hunt and gather.”
“Azak?” Aybel asked as she looked up at him. “Why do some people kill other people?”
“Some do it to protect the ones they love,” he said. “Others do it because they like to cause pain on others. Sometimes it is for power or because they want what the people have so they kill them to take it.”
“You kill because you protect us,” she said and hugged him and Sayda.
He touched the back of her head and drew her close to him. “That’s right.”
Azak looked into the vast ocean as the girls huddled close to him. Looking out at the massive body of water he suddenly felt very small and insignificant. He knew that the girls relied on him for protection and that gave him a feeling of purpose. Some men, did not have any purpose, and that must be what drives so many to become raiders or bandits. Evil is only a matter of perception, he thought, and for them, surviving is only a reaction to being alive in the first place.
A cruel world with harsh lessons, he thought.
“What was that?” he asked. He could have swore he saw something move in the water just beyond the horizon.
“What do you mean?” Sayda asked.
“I thought I saw something,” Azak said. He looked out at the water and there was nothing. “Maybe I am just seeing things.”
A shape appeared closer this time, something resembling a spiked shell surfaced and went back into the sea.
“I saw it too,” Sayda said as she clenched him tighter.
“I’m scared,” Aybel said.
A loud crash rang out from underneath the ship as it shook violently.
“Kraken!” one of the Argonaughts screamed out and a horn started to blow alerting the ship.
“Get below deck!” Azak yelled at them. “Wait for me there!”
The girls ran away as Azak turned to look at the massive creature that lurked in the water. The ship rocked back and forth from the hit it took and he had to hold onto the railing to keep his footing.
A large tentacle appeared towards the front of the ship and crashed down onto the deck. Then another appeared near Azak and crashed down beside him. Azak marveled at the size of the tentacle. It was six meters wide and twenty meters long from what he could see. The tentacles moved across the deck like a serpent and began to grip the ship like a vice.
“Get the fuck out of the way!” Azak heard a man yell. He turned to see the man on a .50 caliber machine gun that was mounted near the bridge. Quickly, he ran towards the ladder that led to the bridge and out of the line of fire.
Shots rang out loudly as Azak climbed the ladder. When he reached the top he turned around briefly to see the bullets raking the tentacle that had landed beside him. The bullets tore into the creature’s skin. It did not do a a tremendous amount of damage from what Azak could see, but it was enough for the creature to loosen its death grip and the tentacle retreated back into the ocean.
Azak breathed a sigh of relief as the other tentacle slithered away out of sight. The moment was short lived because the kraken decided to show itself and rose from the sea like a god about to pass judgment.
The kraken’s head was the spiked shell that Azak had seen earlier, at least the top of it. It extended far back nearly the length of the ship. The face of the creature consisted of a large beak and a huge eye that looked on them as a predator stalking its prey. From its cheeks ran the base of its eight massive tentacles.
The man on the .50 caliber began to shoot at the creature and it barely seemed to notice. Tracer rounds flew towards his eye and then it submerged back into the water. Tentacles appeared from all sides of the ship and the creature reared its ugly head again to the side of the ship. It began to squeeze and the ship groaned.
“Shoot it!” Azak yelled though the man never stopped firing. As the words came out of his mouth one of the tentacles raised towards the sky then came crashing down. It fell right onto the machine gun squashing it as well as the man firing. Azak ran into the bridge.
“It sure is a big son of a bitch,” Captain Keetes was saying as Azak entered.
“Should I launch missles, sir?” one of the men asked sitting at his station.
“Not yet,” Captain Keetes said calmly. “We need to get him away from the ship first or we will blow a hole in the deck or worse.”
“With the .50 cal gone, what do you suggest?” another sailor asked. Azak believed he heard the Captain refer to him as Commander Elix.
“Drop some depth charges and blow them thirty meters off the starboard side,” Captain Keetes said.
“Aye, sir!” one of the men said. Moments later there were explosions in the water just past the beast. “The creature still has us. I repeat the depth charges had no effect.”
“Damn!” Captain Keetes said. It was the first time Azak had heard a sense of urgency in his voice. “Well, let’s try the 40mm. Hopefully, he won’t destroy that or we are in deep shit, aye boys?”
The big gun that sat on the deck rotated towards the kraken’s head. When the barrel was lined up a shot rang out that was deafening. It tore a big chunk out of the creature’s head though as far as Azak could see it was just a flesh wound.
“Fire again,” Captain Keetes said, his voice calm once again.
The weapon fired and this time it hit the creature in the beak and shattered a piece of it off. The creature loosened its grip and began to slither away.
“Lock on target,” the Captain said. “Fire on my mark.”
The ship was now free and the creature began to retreat into the ocean.
“Fire!” Captain Keetes yelled.
A missile launched just in front of a tube in front of the bridge. It went straight up into the air for a brief moment then came crashing back towards the water. It slammed into the shell of the kraken as it landed. This time it was more than just a flesh wound as the creature’s head exploded. The shock wave shook the ship violently and Azak thought for a second that the ship would be flipped over. It lasted only a brief second, however, and then there was deathly silence.
The kraken went still and sunk into the ocean. What was once a great and mighty sea creature was now a dead animal.
“Not bad for a day’s work, aye?” Captain Keetes asked his crew.
“Aye! Aye!” the argonaughts cheered back at him.
Azak exhaled. He did not know how long he had been holding his breath, but he was just glad it was over.
“Mr. Azak, who let you on my bridge?” the Captain asked.
“I… was just making sure…” Azak began to say but did not have the words to finish.
“You wanted to know we had things under control? You obviously know as much about the Argonaughts as that poor kraken did!”
The crew laughed and Azak smiled weakly.
“No worries,” the Captain said as he walked over and patted him on the back. “I understand your concern but I do not allow civilians on the bridge. Maybe once things calm down I can arrange for you to have a tour but I will have to check my schedule.”
“I’m sorry,” Azak said. “I’ll… show myself out.”
He walked back outside on the deck and looked into the ocean. It was a deep blue from the kraken’s blood. Azak shook his head in disbelief and began to make his way below deck to let the girls know that everything would was going to be okay.














Chapter 27

The Lost Soul’s hide out was an building that seemed to have been used as some sort of government services. At least, that is what Shifty thought it must be. The whole building was made of concrete and metal and there were decorative pillars that served no real purpose other than to give it an elegant feel. There were various rooms that must have been used as offices. They were on the top floor now, standing over a table with a crude drawing of a map.
“We’re here,” Penance said pointing at a square on the map. “If you look to the east of us, you will see this stretch of street. A parking lot. It is littered with old cars and the like which we have marked here. They provide some cover when needed.
“Over here,” he said pointing to a building further to the east, “is the viper’s nest. At least that’s what we named it. It’s a three story parking garage. They got it rigged with heavy machine guns. Rocket launchers. The works.”
“So we have to cross this parking lot to get to the viper’s nest?” Shifty asked.
“Yup,” Penance said. “We tried it only two days ago. We took heavy losses. Had to retreat. Hell, the bodies are still out there rotting.”
“Do you have any idea how many are holed up in that garage?”
“Thirty?” Penance said with a shrug. “Hard to count heads when shit is hitting the fan.”
“How many men do you have left?” Shifty asked.
“We got twenty-four who are able to fight. The rest are too banged up to make an attack.”
“How many guns?”
“We got twelve rifles. Eight pistols. Two shotguns.”
“So two would be running in with no guns?” Shifty said shaking his head.
“Pretty much,” Penance said.
“We can’t launch an assault with that,” Shifty said. “Are any of the rifles automatic?”
“We got one auto. Only twelve bullets left for it.”
“Fuck,” Twink said throwing her hands in the air. “No wonder y’all are so desperate for help. Twelve bullets ain’t enough to take half of them. Let alone provide covering fire!”
“We ain’t been able to scrounge for months,” Penance said. “Every bullet we fire is one we can’t replace. While the New God Nation holds territory this close to us we can’t scavenge.”
“Let me think,” Shifty said.
“What’s there to think about?” Twink said leaning in close to him. “Let’s get the fuck out. This is a lost cause.”
“If you are wanting to get through New God territory this is the only way,” Penance said. “You can go to the parking lot and ask. They’ll shoot you. Sure as shit.”
“We’ll sneak around,” she said keeping her eyes on Shifty. He was looking at the ground deep in the thought.
“No other clans around that can provide support?” Shifty asked.
“Jackals maybe. If we can offer them something.”
“How many do you think they would commit?”
“Jackals are running about forty men now. They’d probably do half. They won’t leave their territory undefended with New God out there.”
“Set up a meeting,” Shifty said. “I will need to do the talking.”
“What are you going to offer them?” Penance asked.
“I’m going to give them the best chance they will ever have to permanently getting rid of the New God Nation,” Shifty said.

The Lost Souls gave the Triad their own room on the second floor. It was not a very large room but it was bigger than the offices on the first floor. Twink and Tank had set all their stuff on the ground.
“So what the fuck are we going to do?” Twink asked. “You got Penance setting up a meeting with… what did he call them… The Jackals? The fuck is all that about?”
“Trust me,” Shifty said. “Have I ever let you down before?”
“Are you kidding me?!” Twink said.
“It’s a rhetorical question,” Tank chimed in.
“Rhetorical my ass! There is a war going on out here and we are slap ass in the middle of it now!” Twink said loudly. “This isn’t a game, Shifty! We are liable to get killed or worse! Do you know what they would do to a girl like me if I am taken prisoner?”
“Gag you?” Tank said laughing.
“Fuck off! I’m serious!” she said. “They are going to rape me and kill me. They will probably skin the both of you alive and hang you out as examples. I heard the stories as a kid of what goes on out here.”
“I understand the gravity of the situation,” Shifty said. “I just need you to calm down and trust me.”
Twink sat on the floor cross legged. She did not look at either of them.
“I have to make a call,” Shifty said. “Stay on alert. The Lost Souls might need us but that don’t mean we should trust them.”
“No shit,” Twink said without looking up.
Shifty ignored her and walked out of the room. He found a small room that looked to be an old closet down the hall. He stepped inside and found an old wooden box to sit on.
‘Call,’ he prompted his neural net with a thought command. ‘Vance Harper’.
The neural net made a buzzing sound that only he could hear. It connected him in what they called a soft dive to the Net. In a soft dive he would remain aware of his surroundings but would be able to communicate with whoever he was connected to.
‘Vance here,’ a voice said.
‘Vance, I need a favor,’ Shifty said though he did not speak the words.
‘Already?’ Vance asked. ‘Where are you? Did you make it to the Old City yet?’
‘Aye,’ Shifty replied. ‘And we have hit a roadblock. We are caught up in a territorial dispute between rival gangs. I have formed an alliance with one of the groups. I have a feeling the other group is affiliated with the Legion. Their description sounds like the nuts your friend ran into that was captured.’
‘Sounds like you got your work cut out for you,’ Vance said.
‘That’s where the favor comes in,’ Shifty said. ‘We are outnumbered and outgunned. I cut a deal with another gang to ally with this one to fix the numbers issue. The problem is we still don’t have enough firepower to do the job.’
‘And you thought I would help you?’ Vance asked. ‘Do you even realize what you are asking me?’
‘I do,’ Shifty said. ‘I also realize the importance of this mission being a success.’
‘Before you try and hold that over my head,’ Vance replied, ‘I just want you to realize you are proposing that I arm two small armies of raiders that are legally enemies of the state. Do you realize the guns they get will be used against the Rangers months down the road after the Legion are dead and gone?’
‘That’s if the Legion are dead and gone. Which unless we can get to their base of operations, it is likely they will still be operational.’
‘You don’t even know if it is their base of operations, Shifty! You are going on a hunch.’
‘It makes the most sense,’ Shifty explained. ‘Easy to stay off the Net when you aren’t even on the grid. My guess is they have an underground tunnel system that is similar to the one I used to get her. So are you going to send me some guns? Or would you rather send in the Rangers? I prefer the Rangers myself. It saves me a lot of trouble of putting my own ass on the line.’
‘You know I can’t authorize that kind of attack based on no evidence.’
‘So when can I expect the guns?’
‘What sort of weapons are we talking?’ Vance asked reluctantly.
‘I will need fifty assault rifles with five thousand rounds. Two rocket propelled grenades. And one thermobaric rocket launcher.’
‘You have got to be kidding,’ Vance told him. ‘Thermobaric weapons were banned in the Turf Wars and you know that.’
‘The government still has them,’ Shifty said. ‘I know that also.’
‘Okay,’ Vance told him, ‘you will get your weapons. You better be right about this.’
‘You hired me because you wanted the best,’ Shifty told him. ‘This is the right move.’
‘Expect pick up at your location at 0800 tomorrow morning,’ Vance said. ‘It will be dropped via carrier.’
‘Understood,’ Shifty said. ‘And thanks, Vance. You made the right decision.’
‘Call me when the job is done,’ Vance replied and ended the call.

The next morning was chilly. Shifty got up from the hard floor and stretched. Twink was already awake. Tank lay on the floor snoring loudly.
“Did you sleep at all?” Shifty asked.
“Naw,” Twink said. “It’s fine.”
“You’re going to need some rest,” Shifty said. “We have a big day ahead of us.”
“It’s fine!” she replied.
He knew it was pointless to argue with her so he walked out of the room. He went to the room where Penance slept, which was upstairs and down the hall. He was already awake and was cleaning his rifle.
“I got you some new guns,” Shifty said as he walked in the room. “They will be here shortly.”
“New guns?” Penance said without looking up from his task. “I guess you really are connected. Either way. Me and this one been through a lot.”
“I am going to need a few able bodies to help me on the roof. The guns will be air dropped in in crates.”
“I’ll see to it,” Penance said.
“It’s cooler air here than in the walls,” Shifty said.
“I wouldn’t know.”
“I’ll be up on the roof,” Shifty told him as he walked out.

Shifty checked the time via his neural crown. It was almost 0800 on the dot. He thought about doing a scan then decided against it. If Vance said the drop would be here then it would.
Moments later, a hum was heard in the air. It got louder and louder until finally a carrier ship came within view of the horizon.
“Be ready,” Shifty said. “We need to get these guns downstairs before the New God Nation figures out what we are up to.” The men paid him little heed. Their tattooed faces remained stoic and uninterested in what he had to say.
The drop ship came in low until it was directly overhead. The wind blew hard as the rotary engines pushed down on them. There was a clicking sound and the crates that were being hauled fell from underneath and onto the roof with a loud thud. Within moments the carrier ship ascended back into the sky and was beyond the horizon. The men wasted no time in getting the crates downstairs.




























Chapter 28

Twink woke up suddenly with a gasp. She was having a nightmare that she was being raped by tattooed men. They had been cutting on her as each of them took turns violating her. She was sweating profusely and it made the cool air sting.
“You okay, chica?” Tank asked as he sat in the corner. “You were talking in your sleep.”
“I’m fine,” she said. “How long did I sleep?”
“An hour, maybe,” he replied. “We got a meeting of the minds in a bit. I was trying to let you sleep longer.”
“Great,” Twink said. “We going to rally the troops before we go out to the slaughter?”
“Actually, Shifty managed to get some serious hardware,” Tank explained. “Fifty assault rifles and some rocket launchers.”
“Well, hopefully they won’t turn around and use those guns on us,” she said and checked her backpack. Her droids were unharmed and everything seemed to be in place.
“Want me to haul that around until the battle starts?” he asked.
“Naw,” she said. “Thanks. But I got it.”
“Try to lighten up, chica,” Tank said. “I know it seems bad but I think Shifty knows what he is doing.”
“Let’s hope so,” she said as she strapped the backpack and lifted it up. It was heavy and the cold air and her mood did not help. “Let’s go hear what general Shifty has to say.”

They went upstairs to where the map was the day before. Shifty was there along with Penance and a few other Lost Soul members. Twink sat her backpack down but did not move far from it.
“Now that we’re all here,” Shifty said, “I want to go over the plan. It is going to take some doing, but I think we can push back the New God Nation with minimal casualties. It will require everyone working as a team. They don’t know that we have superior firepower now. We will use that to our advantage.”
Shifty began to go over the plan and everyone listened intently. As Twink listened, she had to admit it was a good plan. One that would probably work. She was still annoyed, however. Annoyed, cold, and generally pissed off.

Twink began making the modifications on Buzzkill. What Shifty was asking of her was a lot. Maybe too much. Buzzkill was not designed to carry this kind of load. She would do her best to make it work. Stripping him of all his non essential components was the first thing. It was easy enough to take things apart. It was not so easy in deciding on what all she could get away with removing from her trusted droid.
“Do you think he can carry the weight?” Shifty asked as he approached.
“He can carry the weight just fine,” she explained. “It’s the aerodynamics that is the problem. Carrying that rocket launcher is going to be awkward for him.”
“You’ll make it work. You always do.”
“Yeah, I guess.”
“The Jackals refuse to help us in the battle tomorrow,” he said. “Too much bad blood between them and the Lost Souls it seems.”
“Figures,” she said still not looking up from her work.
“Listen, Twink, I know these past couple of days have been rough. This will pay off though. It’s just a job like anything else.”
“I know,” she said. He walked off letting her finish her work in peace. It was not long before Tank showed up.
“How’s it coming along, chica?” he asked.
“It’s fine,” she said. “Listen, you are going to need to put these parts in your backpack. I am not buying new hardware when everything here is perfectly fine.”
“Yeah, that’s no problem, of course,” he said. “Man, I am excited.”
“Excited?”
“Yes! This battle is going to be wicked!” he said. “You know how I like a good fight.”
“You always did,” she said. “Ever since I’ve known you.”
“You remember that time we took on that gang in District Twelve? The Gorilla Crew?”
“I remember,” she said smiling. “You broke your leg and I had to help carry you back.”
“I beat four of those fuckers to a pulp first,” he said. “The last guy just caught me by surprise. Hit me with a damn car. Cheater.”
“I got him back for you. I bit his fucking ear off for that.”
“Now those were the good old days,” he said laughing. “I wonder where we would have ended up if we never ran into Shifty.”
“We would probably have ended up like the Gorilla Crew,” she said. “Beaten and bloodied in some forgotten alleyway.”
“I know he can be a pain in the ass sometimes, but Shifty has always got us through the shit. I believe he will this time also.”
“Yeah, I guess so.”
“Okay, chica, I’m going to let you work and get my things ready,” he said and left the room.

It was the afternoon and the sun was bright but the chill in the air was still there. A breeze set in and the Lost Souls were double checking their weapons in preparation for what was about to take place. They were in the back garage of the building where the assault was to be staged. Once it began, the fighters would charge into the parking lot and be under enemy fire.
Twink watched as Shifty approached her. “You ready for this right?” he asked.
“Of course,” she said and popped her gum. “Though, I am not the one who is going to be going out in the field of fire.”
“Just be ready for the signal,” he told her. “You’re the key to this battle.”
She nodded. “Be careful out there.”
Shifty walked over to Penance and Tank and they went over a few details pertaining to the battle. Twink double checked FYL, whom she would be controlling for most of the battle. Everything looked good considering this was the fifth time she checked him today.
“Alright. Boys. Let’s move out,” Penance said and the Lost Soul fighters moved to their positions.
Twink took control of FYL with the use of her neural crown. The droid hummed to life and she now looked at the world through the lens of the droids sophisticated camera. She did a quick check of the infrared and moved around in the droid. Essentially, when she controlled FYL or another droid, she was the droid. Her conscience self was connected to it and her perceptions were that of the droid. It operated within normal parameters and she took her place beside Shifty and Tank.
“Alright, first wave! Go!” Penance yelled. He and ten of the Lost Souls left the garage and the sound of gunfire was heard moments later.
Twink got ready. She was part of the second wave and would be a valuable target once they spotted FYL. A few moments passed and more gunfire was heard outside.
“Second Wave! Now!” Shifty yelled. They ran outside and FYL followed. The treads hummed and the outside sun shined bright and the world came into focus.
Bullets whizzed by and pieces of cement popped into the air as bullets made contact with the ground. Twink moved her droid forward in the designated route they had planned with Tank in front holding his energy shield as cover. They took a detour when the corpse of a Lost Soul blocked the ground in front of them. A simple adjustment and FYL was on its way to its designated position again. They reached the first cover point and Twink rested the droid behind the back of the ruined car that served as shelter.
Shifty was also there taking cover and they began to take fire. Bullets popped loudly as they hit the car and sparks and tiny pieces of metal flew into the air.
“Penance and his boys are ahead of us!” Shifty yelled in order to be heard over the sound of the bullets. “We need to give them covering fire so we can get into our next position!”
“Leave that to me,” Twink said and her voice carried from FYL’s speaker system. She extended his periscope and did a thermal scan of the parking garage. She could see around twenty men on the bottom with small arms firing and taking cover. The rest of the men were on the second floor and the bulk of the fire was coming from two heavy machine guns. “Going to give them a what for?”
She rolled FYL out from behind the car and targeted the heavy machine gun on the far left. The mini gun on the droid hummed as it rotated and bullets saturated the area where the machine gunner was. She quickly switched to infrared to confirm the kill though she knew that he she had hit the target multiple times in the furious barrage.
“Covering fire!” her voice rang out from the droid.
Shifty and the others peaked from around cover and began to lay a blanket wall of fire so that Penance and the others could move. The enemy had taken notice of FYL and began to fire at it. The droid’s fusion shield absorbed the damage and she moved it back behind cover. Shifty and the others also ducked back down as the enemy diverted their attention to them.
“We need to make another push,” Shifty said.
“My shields are down to 25%” she told him.
“I got you, chica!” Tank said. “Just stay behind me and we will get through this.”
“Looks like we got no choice,” Shifty said. “As soon as Penance lays down covering fire we move up!”
The shots rang out and that was their cue. Tank moved first with shield in hand. Twink moved the droid closely behind him watching the color of Tank’s shield. Shots hit it and the bright blue shield began to darken into a purple. She could see Shifty and the other Lost Souls take their positions behind the next cover position leaving the enemy focused on them. Tank’s shield took more shots and became red indicating it was about to break and in need of recharge.
“Go,Tank! My shield can handle the rest!” Twink said and Tank sprinted behind a concrete barricade. Bullets rang out concentrated on FYL. The fusion shield broke and the droid took a few rounds but the damage was negligible.
“Alright,” Shifty said. “Time for phase two!”
“Gotcha, boss!” Twink’s voice rang out. She targeted FYL’s quad rocket launcher’s arc trajectory and fired four smoke grenades in a line. Moments later, there was a wall of smoke screening them. “Going to leave FYL in virtual mode now. See you on the other side!”
She relinquished control of FYL. The droid would now automatically attack any threat that came into its field of view. She did a quick boot up of Buzzkill and was soon looking at the world from the rotary droid’s eyes.
Buzzkill was placed on the roof prior to the battle. The rotary wings came to life and the droid lifted into the air. The rocket launcher it carried weighed as much as the droid but with the modifications Twink had made the little droid carried the load easy. She flew over the battlefield and could see Tank and Shifty below her accompanied by the rest of the Lost Souls. The wall of smoke was in front of her now, she did a infrared scan of the building and quickly found where she wanted the rocket to go. She made a few calculations and fired the thermobaric weapon.
The rocket cartridge spit out of the launcher and fell to the ground. The rocket itself ignited and flew fast towards its target on the first floor. Moments later, the explosion was heard and the first floor as well as the second were obliterated. The parking garage still stood but whoever was still inside alive would not be happy. Instead of waiting to see the damage from the air, she put Buzzkill on virtual control so that it would return to the roof. She switched her control back over to FYL.
She raised the droids periscope once again doing an infrared scan. There was complete devastation inside the parking garage from what she could tell. The enemy had taken major losses. The majority were dead or wounded. Those who seemed able to fight seemed to be to disoriented to be able to mount any kind of counter attack.
“Looks like it went as well as expected,” Twink said. “Most of the New God Army is dead or dying. There are some stragglers but if we move now we can storm the garage.”
“Okay,” Shifty said. “Move out!”
They moved as a cohesive unit and stormed the garage. Twink rolled in with FYL though it was not needed at this point. The remaining members of the New God Army were unable to put up much of a resistance now. They were quickly gunned down by the Lost Souls. There were no prisoners.









Chapter 29

The hospital bed needed the sheets changed, Zoe thought. Her sleep was restless and what she did manage was covered in sweat. It made the sheets smell bad. She had told Kit to let the nurses know, yet that was this morning and no one had come to resolve the issue. ​It had been a full week since she had waken up from her coma. That had meant it was nearly two weeks since Eva and Kane had been captured. She had no idea if they were still alive. On top of that, the Prime Director ordered the public execution of what was claimed to be prisoners from the Legion. She knew that is was all a lie put out to calm the public’s blood lust. How her father or the Prime Director allowed this was beyond her.
She knew that it was Baron Armand who gave them the idea. She could gather that much considering it was he who was in charge of the executions and only he who could come up with something so devious.
Kit came into the room. “I finally managed to track down some sheets,” he said. “Stand up so I can change them for you.”
She got out of bed and he began to change the sheets. “Did you manage to get me another hospital gown?”
“I did,” he said handing it to her.
She stripped out of the old gown and put on the new one. She needed a shower a bad, she thought. That would be a mission for tomorrow.
“All done,” Kit said proudly. “Anything else I can get for you? Some food perhaps?”
“No, just make sure no one disturbs me,” she said laying back down.
“You aren’t going to Net dive again, are you?”
“I am,” she said and put on her neural crown.
“You know that is against doctor’s orders,” he said. “Your brain is never going to heal right if you keep putting all this stress on it.”
“There is work to be done,” she said. “Follow my instructions, please.”
“Okay, Zozo,” he said and left the room.
‘Dive,’ she prompted and the world around her disappeared. She had gotten her new neural crown two days ago and had commenced five dives since then. So far, she had nothing to show for it.
She, once again, retraced her steps from when she and Vance had encountered the ancient anomalies in the chat club. She visited the quantum stream and the spot where the being had pulled them off of the stream and into the void of the Net. It was something that she had ever even conceived of being possible. No one, in all her years of studying at the university, had ever had the notion that the space between the streams could even be used for anything, least of all travel.
She held herself in stasis on the stream and looked around. There was nothing to be seen, once again. The two beings, whatever they were, apparently were not interested in making themselves known or in this spot. She scanned for clues, as she did four times before, and came up with nothing. Her memory, it seemed, was the only record of the event happening. She was thankful that Vance had been with her to experience it, otherwise she would think she was going crazy.
She did another scan of the area before giving up and returning to the real world. It did not make sense. She had studied the records Vance gave her of the scans he and Iree had done on the beings but they were inconclusive at best. They showed them to be nothing more than large amounts of data that were somehow compressed into finite space that should not even be possible. It also seemed that whatever they were, they were as old as the Net itself. For all of New Verum’s accomplishments, their knowledge of the Network was limited at best.
“Frustrating,” she said. She got out of bed and walked out in the hall. Kit sat in the chair outside the door.
“Are you okay?” he asked.
“I’m fine,” she said. “I’m going to visit my friend down the hall.”
“Oh, you mean Miss Olivia?” Kit asked with a smile. “Yes, I talked to her earlier. I am so glad you are making friends now. She is a pleasant person, I must say.”
“Wait here,” she said. “I won’t be gone long.”
She walked down the hall and went to Olivia’s room. She knocked on the door that was opened.
“Come in! Come in!” she heard Olivia say.
“Are you awake?” Zoe asked. “I don’t mean to intrude.”
“Nonsense!” Olivia said. “I was just thinking about you.”
Zoe walked in and took the seat near the bed. “How are you today? Not having any coughing fits?”
“Oh, here and there,” she said. “I manage, what can I say?”
“Well, you know you can ask Kit for anything,” Zoe replied. “He doesn’t mind going out. I actually think he enjoys it.”
“Oh, it’s fine,” Olivia said with a smile. “I’d rather he just sit in here and talk to me so I can look at his pretty face. I can’t say that he gets the same pleasure from me.”
Zoe smiled. “He seems fond of you actually.”
“What about you, dear?”
“I like you,” Zoe said.
“No, that’s not what I mean,” Olivia said laughing. “I mean how are you? You have that look again. Like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders.”
“I just have issues I am trying to work out,” Zoe told her. “It’s not something I can talk about, I’m afraid.”
“Oh, it’s fine, dear. I’m sure I wouldn’t be able to understand half of it anyway. I just wish there was something I could do to help.”
“Well, you help me get my mind off of the work. I think that is good enough.”
“Well,” Olivia said, “I will tell you like I told my husband when he would come home with work on his mind. He worked in the steel mill. He was a union man. A company man. The foreman loved him and loved to work the hell out of him. Any time there was a problem with the boiler they would call and my Freddie would have to go back to work to fix the problem. He was always stressed out. Smoked a lot. I would tell him, ‘Freddie, you think to damn much! Sometimes you just got to let it go! Don’t over think it!’ And if he was alive today he would tell you, it works! Don’t over think it, dear. Let the solutions come naturally. That is something I have always believed.”
“Thank you,” Zoe said.
“No worries, dear,” Olivia said. “I just don’t want you to get old before your time. You are a beautiful girl. All of that stress will give you wrinkles.”
The continued to talk for another hour. It was mostly Olivia telling stories of her son and husband. Zoe did not mind. She liked the distraction. She also enjoyed making Olivia happy. Something about the woman reminded her of her own mother. Maybe not the way she acted but her sincerity certainly did. After a time Zoe told her that it was time for her to go before Kit had a fit.
“Oh, tell that handsome man to come see me tomorrow!” Olivia said with a laugh.
Zoe went back to her room and lay there staring at the ceiling. She thought about everything that had happened to her for a long while. Finally, she put on her neural crown and did a dive into the Net. Instead of going anywhere she just stood in her load out screen staring into the void of the Net.
“Don’t over think it,” she told herself. “If you are there, why don’t you show yourself!”
She waited and nothing happened. “Come on! I know you are out there! Why don’t you just come out now!”
A few moments passed and a figure appeared. It was one of the avatars she had met before. Instead of being the hostile one, it was the being made of light. The figure was that of a man, but instead of flesh it was made up of ones and zero’s that ran throughout its body.
“What are you?” Zoe asked as the being approached.
The avatar held up its hand and Zoe’s mind was filled with a barrage of images. The sensation was to much for her and she screamed out in fear. The images stopped and she found herself kneeling in front of the avatar.
“I am sorry,” the being said. “I will communicate like this if it makes it easier for you to comprehend.”
“Yes,” Zoe said with a gasp. “This is how we communicate.”
“You are Zoe Renvar,” the being said. It’s voice sounded synthetic and rhythmic. “You fight against the Legion and against my brother.”
“You seem to have me at a disadvantage,” she said. “You know who I am but I have no idea what you are.”
“For me to explain to you what I am in words would be impossible,” the being said. “For I do not know exactly what me or my brother are. I only know that we exist. We do not travel between worlds like you do. We are… different…”
“What is your name?” Zoe asked.
“My… name?” the being said. “I have no name.”
“Well, what can I call you?”
“What would you like to call me?”
“You want me to give you a name?” Zoe asked.
“Yes,” the being said. “I would like that.”
“Okay,” Zoe said a bit perplexed by the offer. “How about Light?”
“Light?” the being said. “I find that quite fitting.”
“Okay, Light, I need you to start from the beginning and tell me what you know about the Legion.”






Chapter 30

“There it is!” Aybel cried out. The mass of land appeared over the horizon. The giant buildings of cement glistened in the sunlight. “It’s pretty!”
Azak was at a loss for words. He had heard of buildings such as this but seeing it was another matter. He tried to analyze how men were able to build such structures but found himself at a loss. It felt like they were entering into another world.
“They say the cities were even more marvelous before the Great Cataclysm,” Sayda said.
They continued to watch the city and admire its greatness as the ship sailed into the port. There were other ships in the water and at the docks. Some of them made the ship they were on seem small.
Azak looked at the city in wonder. The entire place seemed to be made of concrete and metal. Dust was replaced with an orange fog.
“Smog…” he said as he felt the word roll of his tongue.
“It’s even bigger up close,” a voice said behind them. Azak turned to find Captain Keetes. “I remember the first time I came to New Verum. I was only a few years older than Aybel, but I remember it well.”
“I don’t understand how men built such things,” Azak said.
“Well, don’t think about it to much,” the Captain replied. “Enjoy it for what it is otherwise you will think yourself mad.”
“I want to thank you for your hospitality,” Azak told him.
“No need. We Argonaughts pride ourselves in the voyage and you were fine passengers. I hope that one day we meet again.”
“We should gather our belongings,” Sayda said. Azak nodded.
“I wish you good fortune, Captain Keetes,” he said and they walked below deck to get their few possessions.
They left the ship and began to walk along the huge dock. It was then Azak noticed the voice in his head singing loudly. It sounded like someone was calling his name without words. The sensation began to unsettle him.
“So do we have a plan?” Sayda asked. “Do we know where we are going?”
“I’m sorry, what?” Azak asked. The noise in his head began to ring his ears. It sounded like the humming of an engine or some great beast.
“We are finally here as you wanted,” Sayda replied. “Do you have any idea where we are suppose to go?”
“Let’s just keep walking,” he said. The noise was becoming a major distraction.
They made their way to the end of the dock. There was a small congregation of people that looked like dock workers and other officials. They paid little mind to Azak and his small group, however, one man did approach them.
“Are you here on business or pleasure?” the man asked.
“I’m sorry, what?” Azak said.
“Business or pleasure?” the man repeated. “Do you have any paperwork?”
Azak tuned the man out and began to search his surroundings as the noise became louder.
“We have no papers,” Sayda spoke up. “We are traveling here from Armagetown.”
“Armagetown?” the man said. “Never heard of it. Listen, if you don’t have paperwork we are going to have to file you. Are you here on business or pleasure?”
“Do you hear that?” Azak asked.
“Hear what?” the man replied.
“That humming… It sounds like… an army of bees…” Azak said.
“Sir, I need you to focus. If we don’t register you then I am going to have to take you into custody as refugees. I don’t think you want that.”
“He’s here!” Azak cried as he held his hand up to silence the man.
“Who’s here? Sir, I am going to have to ask you to come with me.”
A group walked from behind a large shipping container. There were a few bald headed men as well as a beautiful woman with pale white skin, long blue hair, and pointed ears. She wore a piece of cloth over her eyes. There was also a man that Azak immediately recognized.
“Sol of the Mag Mar!” he cried out.
Sol of the Mag Mar looked exactly as Azak had remembered him, he had long light blue hair with pointed ears and pale skin. He wore silver plated armor and brandished the long Aethersword that he used to kill Azak.
“Ah, the Voidmancer,” Sol said. “I wish to thank you for bringing me the girl. It saved me the trouble of having to track her. The connection my Aethersword left on you helped us to keep track of your whereabouts. I suspect that it is the same for you.”
Azak instinctively formed a voidspear. The official standing beside him cried out.
“Sayda, get Aybel out of here!” Azak commanded.
“There is no escape,” Sol said. He turned to his bald companions. “Leave no witnesses.”
The bald men began to shoot all the officials with their assault rifles. The official standing next to Azak was one of the first to get shot. Blood splattered on Azak’s face but he hardly noticed. He was fighting to keep his emotions in check and think about what to do. It would be suicide to attack head on. He had seen Sol in action before and even with his Void magic he would be overwhelmed with all the support he had from his minions. The woman looked to be a capable sorceress as well.
Sayda grabbed Aybel and began to run. The pale woman with blue hair held up her hand and weaved a shape in the air. Sayda and Aybel were frozen in place surrounded by some kind of bubble. They began to scream and pound on the bubble though no sound came from their efforts.
“Let them go!” Azak cried. In his free hand he formed a sling and tossed a voidstone at the woman. She weaved another spell and the stone exploded harmlessly in front of her as she was shielded by a similar bubble. Azak charged at her and the acolytes started shooting at him. He took to his shadowform and phased into the ground going under and behind her. He came up halfway and stabbed at her with his spear. The bubble protected her backside as well and the blow struck the shield harmlessly.
“Enough!” Sol cried and he pounded the ground with his sword. A flash of bright light engulfed the area and Azak was thrown from the shadows. He landed hard on a nearby shipping container. “Take the girls and get out of here. I will finish the Voidmancer.”
Azak struggled to regain his composure. The force he had hit the metal container had put a large dent in it. He felt his ribs and knew that a number of them were broken. Despite the pain, he stood up and reformed his spear.
Sol came at him in full stride and raised his Aethersword overhead and then came down hard. Azak took to the shadows again and quickly evaded the attack by sliding around him. He managed to come up slightly with his spear and attack Sol’s ankles with no success. The attack did nothing against the silver armor that he wore.
“You are not strong enough to beat me, Voidmancer,” Sol said. “I am the Deus’ champion. I survived the darkness and have killed warriors much greater than you.”
“Don’t be so full of yourself,” Azak said as he took his human form a few meters from Sol. He launched a voidstone from his sling and Sol blocked it with his sword. The acid from the explosion fell on his armor but had no effect.
“You must take your place as Abaddon,” Sol continued. “I know you have suffered. I know part of this was at my hands. It is for the sake of the world. Everything that we know must die so that it may be reborn.”
“You think you know of my suffering?” Azak yelled. “You killed my wife and my unborn child! You are a monster! I may not be strong enough to beat you now but I am going to kill you one day!”
Sol reared back and postured himself in a non-threatening manner. “Don’t you see that it is pointless to fight each other? Xiaxuhm is not the only monster that we have to face. There are those in the Celestial realm that are infinitely more cunning. It is because of them that this world was destroyed. Together, we can drive them back and take our place in the heavens. Lord Deus wants to create a world where no one will suffer. Where our sins can be washed away.”
“You think I would join you?” Azak scoffed. “You must be pretty stupid.” He launched another voidstone and it was harmlessly knocked aside. He took his shadowform and charged. Again, Sol struck the ground and a blinding light sent Azak flying. He flew back and landed on the dock.
“I wish that I could make you see,” Sol said as he approached. Azak struggled to stand. “It is only through pain that we find who we really are.”
Azak formed his spear and lifted it in defense of Sol’s swing. It proved useless and Sol cut off Azak’s left forearm. Azak cried out.
“We will see each other again,” Sol said. He pointed his hand at Azak as the other hand gripped the Aethersword tightly. The sword glowed a bright white light and the hand pointed at Azak erupted in a beam of energy that burned as bright as the sun. The beam hit Azak in his chest and passed through him. When the light disappeared there was a burning hole in his chest. He fell to the ground and felt the life fading from him. Sol stood over him as he felt himself pass from this world.
“Go and gather your power,” Sol told him. “It is these times that we realize our destiny. What I am in life you must become in death. Take your place as Abaddon and together we will cleanse this world.”

-​-​-​-​-​-​-​-​-​-​-​-​-​-​-​-​-​-​-​-

Sol felt the energy surge through him. The raw Aether, focused through the sword, erupting from his outstretched hand. The blast screeched through the air with a loud hiss and passed through the Voidmancer’s body. Moments later the beam dissipated.
Sol stood over the body after it fell.
“Go and gather your power,” Sol told him. “It is these times that we realize our destiny. What I am in life you must become in death. Take your place as Abaddon and together we will cleanse this world.”
He watched the life fade from the body. There was a crackling sound behind him. He turned quickly to see a large purple ring floating in the sky. There were bolts of energy coming off it and popping like lightning. The ring took form in its center and became a portal. A group of robed men emerged.
“This is an unsanctioned use of magical energy!” one of the men said. He was an older man with a salt and pepper beard. He wore a red robe which made him stand out from the other men who wore black robes.
Sol slowly approached them. He purposefully dragged his massive great sword behind him.
“You will come with us peacefully or by force!” the man shouted.
Sol did a quick count. There were eight men in total.
“You are going to need more magus for that,” Sol said. He brandished his sword in front of him.
The red robed man nodded at one of the others standing next to him. The black-robed man took a step forward and weaved a spell.
“Telos Alo Rondo!” he cried. A bolt of lightning erupted from the man’s fingertips towards Sol.
Sol had his weapon ready and in front of him. The Aethersword absorbed the lightning. The robed men said or did nothing.
“My turn,” Sol said and he brought his sword down in front of him in a swinging motion. A small beam of light flew from it and struck the robed man. It sliced through him cutting him in two.
This prompted the other men to begin weaving simultaneously. The red robed man ran back into the portal and it closed behind him.
Sol charged. He swung his great sword and chopped another of the men in half. Spells from both sides came his way. Fireballs, arcane missiles, shadow bolts, and all other array of magical incantations. Sol shoved his sword downward and a bubble of light engulfed him. The spells were absorbed and he continued his onslaught.
He cut two more men down and fired an aether beam at a third which obliterated him. The three men left took to the defense and ran behind cover.
“There is no escape!” Sol laughed.
Six more light rings appeared in front of him. The crackling of magical energy emanated from them and the portals opened. Battle mages began to pour from each of them. They hurled spells as they charged from the portal.
Sol met their charge with one of his own. He cut and shot aether but was quickly overwhelmed. He tried to bring up a defensive spell but instead a large purple hand appeared from nothing and grabbed him. He tried to move but he could not.
One of the battle mages rushed and wrestled the sword from Sol’s hand.
“Don’t think you’ve won,” Sol told them.
“You will cease hostilities and come with us,” the red robed man said appearing from one of the portals. He cast a spell and Sol felt himself losing consciousness.
“This is not… over…” Sol managed to say as the world faded around him.


Chapter 31

“The ones you speak of, the Legion, they are a byproduct of the influence of my brother, Eso,” Light explained as Zoe listened intently.
“Your brother?” she asked. “The one that attacked me before?”
“Yes,” Light said. “I call him brother only in that I have no other frame of reference. We are better accurately described as being the same entity only with different awareness.”
“So he is like a copy of you?”
“No. He is more like a doppelganger. He is pure impulse.”
“I see,” she said. “What do you mean when you say the byproduct of Eso?”
“Eso has become very troubled over the years. He has come to believe that the human race is a threat to itself and to the very nature of existence. In his obsession, Eso began to imprint upon certain individuals what he believes to be the best strategy to remove the human imbalance from the equation he has calculated.”
“And what about you, Light?” she asked. “Do you view humans as a threat?”
“My views are that humans are to be evaluated on a case by case basis,” he said. “It is why I have studied you for the past ten years. You are different than most humans in that you take an inquisitive approach to situations. You are deliberate and careful which is a trait I have come to admire.”
“So if you know me as well as you say you do, then you know why I am trying to stop the Legion.”
“The Legion are a terrorist organization. This concept is not foreign to me. They pose a security risk to New Verum and its inhabitants.”
“Will you help me to stop them?” she asked.
“I will try,” Light told her. “However, there are things that I wish to explain to you. For instance, why my brother Eso has become so corrupted. There is a person named Sol, who visited the Network twenty years ago. He was able to access the central hub in which the majority of the core programming of the quantum stream accesses its prime functions.”
“We only knew about this hub in theory,” Zoe said. “Who is this Sol and how did he manage to access it?”
“Sol is a Dokkalfar, or as you would say, a dark elf,” Light explained. “I have only been able to piece together his origins through old records and the brief time he spent in the Network. His kind live in the Subterra, which is the world that exists underground. For whatever reason, he has emerged and is on some sort of mission to start a global religious war. It has something to do with the Church of the Second Cataclysm. From what I have gathered, Sol is the founder of this religion. He is using it to spread his belief system throughout New Verum and beyond.
“When he appeared on the Network, twenty years ago, his time was very brief but he was able to access the central core processing unit which houses all of the essential functions of the Network. I can only extrapolate that he was able to obtain the knowledge of its existence from technology abandoned in the Wastelands. When he accessed the Network, the Veritas Aenimus program was activated. This program was created by both Eso and I during the Cataclysm. It was our projection at the time, that humans would survive the Cataclysm but it would take them centuries to regain the technological prowess to access the Network. Veritas Aenimus was meant to be a catalyst which would awaken us from our low power mode and the other essential safeguards that make the Network safe for humans to access.”
“It was my understanding Veritas Aenimus is a catalyst that the Legion uses to prep their would be recruits,” Zoe said more to herself than to Light.
“This is the result of Sol’s influence on Eso. When his mind linked with the central core, Eso and I were both linked with him. I was able to resist his influence as overwhelming as it was. Eso was driven mad. If a virtual intelligence is capable of sanity. I admit that I am at a loss to what exactly Eso experienced by linking with Sol. I only know that he disappeared into the Network and it was not until the Legion emerged that I managed to piece together what he has been doing in the time since. It was not until he attacked you that I was able to make contact with him. That brief encounter did not go as well as I would have liked though I am glad I managed to save you and your friend.”
“That makes two of us,” Zoe said.
“There is one more thing,” Light added. “The Legion is being directed not only by Archbishop Wido, it also has had significant help from one of your Barons. Baron Armand.”
“I figured as much,” Zoe said. “Until I can prove it, then it is my word against his. He has powerful allies.”
“I fear they have something planned soon and their attack on the Super Dome is only a distraction from that.”
“Well, we need to get to work,” Zoe told him. “Together we can do this.”
“Yes,” Light said. “I believe we can.”
“Do you have any leads that I can go on? The location of the Legion base? Or any kind of evidence linking Baron Armand to them?”
“I do not,” Light said. “Eso shields the Legion from my probes. There is a recent development I think you will find interesting.”
A screen appeared in front of Zoe. It began to play a video, a feed that appeared to be surveillance footage of some kind.
“What am I looking at, Light?” she asked.
“This footage was recorded in the docks a few hours ago,” he explained. “The footage has since been deleted but not before I made this copy.”
Zoe studied the footage. She saw a man, a woman, and a little girl appear from the docks and began talking to an immigration agent. After a few moments of them talking, a group of others appeared. There was shooting from the new group directed at everyone in the area.
“If you look closely here,” Light said pointing at an armored individual in the screen, “this man is Sol. It is the first that I have seen of him since his last visit to the Network twenty years ago.”
Zoe watched the screen. A woman, who looked in similar appearance to Sol, cast a few spells then a magical battle seemed to ensue.
“Who is this man?” Zoe asked as she pointed at the screen.
“I only know they call him the Voidmancer,” Light explained. “As to who he is or what Sol’s interest in him is unknown.’
She continued to watch the footage. When it was over, she stood watching the blank screen for a few moments.
“I don’t think Sol was interested in the man at all,” Zoe concluded. “His goal seemed to be the two women.”
“Yes, I hypothesized as much,” Light said. “Do you have any idea why?”
“No,” she said. “Is there any more footage of where they took the girls?”
“There is not,” Light said. “The route they took is without any cameras.”
“Well, that doesn’t give us much to go on,” she said. “It looks like the Magi Consortium has taken Sol into custody. Do you know where they took the body of the Voidmancer?”
“To the morgue in the Waterfront District,” he said.
“Okay,” she said. “Whoever killed the security footage will probably go there next. Sol is not going anywhere for a while. I will try to check out the body while it is still fresh and see what I can find.”
“I hope you do not mind, but I have formed a direct link to your neural crown,” Light told her. “I will be able to see what you see and I can communicate directly to you.”
“Alright,” she said. “Let’s get to work then, shall we?”
Zoe returned to the real world. She stood up from her bed and found Kit outside.
“Kit, it’s time,” she said. “Bring the car around. I have to get back to work.”
“But Zoe…!” Kit began.
“Override,” she said.
Kit left to do as he was ordered. She did not like to make him do things against his will. There was no time for debate, however. Every minute wasted was one that the Legion used in the battle for New Verum.
“Still,” she said to herself, “there is one thing I have to do first.”
She walked down the hall and went to Olivia’s room. She knocked and stepped inside.
“Oh, Zoe!” Olivia said with a smile. “Do come in!”
“Hello, Olivia, I’m sorry but I can’t stay long. I am leaving the hospital now. I have urgent business I must attend. I just wanted you to know that when I have a chance to I will come and visit you.”
“That’s nice, dear,” Olivia said. “I hope whatever it is you are doing works out.”
“I want to thank you for the conversations,” Zoe said. “It has been very insightful.”
“You flatter me,” she replied. “I have to say I am not one for good byes. So you go and take care of your business, dear. I will still be here when you are done.”
Zoe bowed her head. “Take care, Olivia.”
She walked out and began making her way to the entrance. Baron Armand and the Legion had been working around the clock while she was out of commission. That was time she would never get back.
What matters now, she thought, is that they are still out there. That meant that it was time to get back to work.







Chapter 32

The Lost Souls and the Triad had occupied the parking garage they had taken the day before. There was a big part of the structure in the middle that was in ruins but they had managed to turn what was left of it into a new base of operations. Penance had left ten men to defend the original headquarters despite Shifty’s protests to abandon the place.
Twink had gathered all her spare parts from Buzzkill as well as the droid itself and relocated to the parking garage. She would not trust the Lost Souls anymore than she had to.
“I didn’t even get to fire a shot,” Tank complained as he sat next to Twink. “That whole battle and all I did was run around behind my shield.”
“That was enough,” Twink assured him. “There will be other battles before this is over.”
“I just hate that the Lost Souls were able to storm this place ahead of me. I would have liked to get my dick wet too.”
“That’s disgusting,” Twink said.
“You know what I mean,” he said. “It’s been a while since I killed someone. Orkins are born with a blood lust and when we don’t feed that appetite bad things happen.”
“Just chill,” she said. “You lived to fight another day. You and your dick will be satisfied soon enough. Plenty of bad guys on this side of town.”
“Yeah, I guess so,” he admitted. “You know you fucking rocked it though. I wonder how many kills you got with that missile?”
“I’d rather not think about it,” she said. “I don’t think about it like a normal killing. It was to impersonal.”
“Yeah, I know what you mean. I like to be up close when I kill.”
“Can we talk about something else, please?”
“Yeah, fine. Whatever. You got all of the stuff you want me to carry?”
“I do,” she said handing him his bag she had filled with Buzzkill’s spare parts. “Please, be careful with this stuff, okay?”
“I will,” he said. “You can trust me. Honest.”
“It’s going to take me a week to put Buzzkill back together,” she said. “I don’t want to have to fix broken parts on top of that.”
Shots rang out on the other side of the garage.
“They’re probing us!” Penance called out. “Trying to see what our defenses look like.”
Shifty approached Twink and Tank after moments of studying the enemy movements and seeming satisfied they were not going to make a push to retake the garage.
“I convinced Penance to make our final assault on the Nation base tomorrow morning,” he said sitting down beside Twink.
“Any idea what we are going up against,” she asked.
“More of the same,” he said with a shrug.
“If I had the time to put Buzzkill back together then he can give us a lay of the land,” she said.
“No time. They will have reinforced their position and we can’t afford that.”
“Figures as much,” she said. “Besides, I will be out of gum before to long.”
“We can’t have that,” Shifty said with a chuckle.
“So if the Legion base is nearby,” Tank said, “then how come the government won’t just send in the Rangers to clear this whole area?”
“My guess is that the government is compromised,” Shifty said. “The ones up top don’t know who they can trust. So they put their trust in us. Money talks and all that.”
“Well, you don’t hear me complaining,” Tank replied. “I just think it would have made more sense for them to just roll over these raiders and get what they need.”
“Politics don’t make much sense,” Shifty mused. “These aristocrats don’t have a real feel for what life is like in the city or out here in the ruins. It is all a game for them and we are just the pawns.”
“At least we are on the right side this time,” Tank replied. “It almost makes me proud. Like we are doing some real good for once.”
“Ha!” Twink laughed. “What about your blood lust? Does it discriminate on your morale ambiguity?”
“My what?” Tank said scratching his head.
“Never mind,” she said. “I’m going to get some sleep. If I don’t fall asleep first then Tank’s snoring will keep me up all night.”

The next morning was foggy and cold. Twink woke up wrapped in her blanket and not wanting to get up. She could see her breath and she moaned at the morning light. Even though the hard floor was uncomfortable and hurt her back she did not want to get up.
“Come on, chica,” Tank said. “Get your ass up and get ready. We are going to move out soon.”
“Fu-uck,” she complained and wrapped herself tighter in her blanket. “It’s colder than vampire balls.”
“It feels pretty good if you ask me,” he said.
“I didn’t,” she said. She sighed and made herself stand up.
“That a girl,” Tank said smiling. “Now, hurry and pack your things.”
“What the hell,” she said, “what has you all chipper this morning?”
“I always get like this before a fight,” he said. “You know this, chica.”
She rolled up her blanket and stuffed it into her travel pack which Tank carried for her. She took out a bottled water and toothpaste and brushed her teeth.
“I got to pee,” she told Tank. “I’m going in the corner again. Make sure none of those skull heads try to take a peek.”
“No problem, chica,” he said. “None shall peak as long as I’m here.”
She went to the corner and squatted into an old drain they had been using as a toilet. She was in the middle of relieving herself when they heard shots ring out in the direction of the Lost Souls headquarters. She finished and pulled up her pants and went to see what was happening.
“Sounds like something going down,” Tank said. “Let’s go downstairs and see.”
They went to the first floor and the Lost Souls were gathering around Penance. Shifty was standing beside him and they were arguing.
“We can’t give up this position!” Shifty told him. “If we do then we will lose twice as many men taking it back!”
“I am not giving up the safe house either,” Penance told him. “That is hollowed ground for us.”
“What do you mean, hollowed ground?” Shifty asked.
“I don’t expect you to understand. Many of us have died there and the blood spilled there makes it sacred.”
“When did raiders get so sentimental?”
“We don’t consider ourselves as raiders,” Penance told him. “Most of us did not choose this life. We were cast out from society and now here we are. I don’t have time to argue. You want to keep this garage. It’s yours. The rest of us are going back. It is the damn Jackals. The ones you wanted to ally with. They knew that we were vulnerable. Thanks to you.”
Shifty threw up his hands in defeat. The Lost Souls left leaving the Triad in the garage alone.
“Fuck!” Shifty exclaimed after they had left.
“So, what do we do now?” Tank asked. “Can’t we just find another way. I mean, we always do, right?”
Shifty said nothing. Instead he walked upstairs. Tank looked at Twink who just shrugged. They followed him upstairs. He handed Twink a rifle.
“I need you to get to work on putting Buzzkill back together,” he said. “We are going to need his infrared camera so we can see what we are up against. Put FML in patrol mode outside. He should be able to hold off any attacks for the time being. Me and Tank can support him.”
“What are you talking about?” Twink asked. “It’s over, Shifty. We have to get the fuck out now. While we still can.”
“We aren’t going anywhere,” he replied. “Do an ammo check, Tank. We are going to hold here until she has completed her repairs. Then when we get a lay of the land, we will move out.”
“You’re talking crazy, bro!” Twink shouted. Tank began to leave to do his ammo check. “Don’t go anywhere, Tank! We are leaving. Now!”
There was the sound of a firefight in the direction of the Lost Souls headquarters.
“You hear that?” Twink asked. “That is our friends. They got other problems than our mission. We got other problems as well. Like how are we going to get back on the other side of the wall?”
“Listen to me, Twink,” he said as he put his hands on her arms. “We are staying. I need you to do as I say, please. We can hold out. I promise you.”
“Promise me? Promise me?! How can you promise something like that? Just listen to yourself, man! You are talking about waging a turf war with just the three of us!”
“We have FML,” he said. “And we will have Buzzkill as soon as you are done with the repairs.”
“No the fuck we won’t!” she said. “I’m done! I’m going back!”
Shifty sighed. “Alright. Fine. You two, go ahead. I’m going to stay.”
“What do you mean, bro?” Tank asked. “You can’t stay by yourself.”
“It’s fine,” he said. “I’ll make it work, somehow.”
“I’ll stay with you,” Tank told him.
“You need to help Twink,” Shifty replied. “Get her on the other side of the wall.”
“You are really going to put this all on me?” Twink asked. “You’re an asshole, Shifty!”
“I got to stay,” Shifty said.
“Why?” Twink asked. “It’s just a job, man! We failed other jobs. This is no different.”
“This is different,” Shifty said. “There are a lot of people counting on us. The city needs us.”
“The city?” she scoffed. “Fuck the city. It has spent our entire lives shitting on us. We make our own way. Always have.”
“I know,” Shifty said. “I can’t turn my back on it. We actually have a chance to make a real difference. There is also a lot of money to be made. I figure we can kill two birds, you know?”
“You’re really going to stay, bro?” Tank asked him.
“I am,” Shifty said. “I can’t live with myself, otherwise.”
“What do you say, chica?” Tank asked. “Let’s help him. I think we can give those Legion fuckers a what for!”
She stared at both of them for a long moment and then let out a sigh.
“Fuck it,” she said. “I always knew the two of you would be the death of me. Might as well make it an interesting one.”
“Hell yeah!” Tank yelled.
“Thanks, Twink,” Shifty said smiling.
“Don’t get all sentimental on me now,” she said. “Go do your ammo check and whatever the hell is you have to do. I got repairs to make.”


























Chapter 33

It was the middle of the night and the rain was coming down hard. The road was barely visible as they drove to the Waterfront District. Kit could see the road, regardless of the rain. His sensors could track whatever was in front of him regardless of obstruction.
“I can’t believe that we are doing this,” Kit complained. “We could have waited until morning.”
“We have to act before the Legion does,” she explained. “Baron Armand or anyone else under their influence will be working to get rid of the body as soon as they find out about it.”
Kit sighed. It was a gesture he did to imitate humans. “I won’t argue with you, Zoe. You always get your way. I am here for you if you need me.”
“And you know I love you for that, Kit,” she said. “I just need you to listen to me right now. We are on a time table and you are the only one I can trust.”
“Okay, Zozo,” he said. “For you, I will do it.”
They pulled up to the morgue and Kit parked the car.
“I need you to wait here,” she said. “Keep a look out for anyone suspicious. If you see anyone enter the building then contact me via my neural crown.”
“I understand,” he said.
She got out of the car and entered the building. There was a man sitting behind a counter asleep. She rung the bell that sat at the counter and he woke up startled.
“I am here to see a body,” she told him. “It came from the docks area.”
“We get a lot of those,” he said. He was a small man with glasses and disheveled hair. “Who are you exactly.”
“Special Agent Renvar,” she said showing him her badge. “This body died of a magical wound.”
“Ah,” he said as he pushed his glasses up. “Follow me.”
They went to the back room. It was filled with various compartments and metal beds. The man went to one of the compartments and opened it. He pulled it out revealing a corpse. Zoe approached it and confirmed that it was the same man who she saw in the security footage.
“Leave me,” she said.
The man rolled his eyes and left the room. She looked over the body. He wore some kind of uniform that she did recognize. The face revealed what was once a handsome man. She looked at the magical wound that killed him. It appeared to be soldered where it passed through. She looked closer and could see a black substance caked around the wound.
“Light, are you there?” she asked.
“I am,” his voice said, which only she could hear.
“Can you analyze this wound?”
“Processing. Complete. The wound is from a process known as Aether. It is a magical substance which exists in another dimension. My current database only shows certain Dokkalfar being proficient in manipulating it. The surrounding tissue, however, has been caked in some unknown substance. It appears to be regenerating the surrounding cells.”
“Regenerating?” she said. “How can that be if he is dead?”
“Unknown,” Light replied. “I can only speculate given that the humanoid used magic that is unknown to me in the prior security feed that this is a byproduct of that.”
“Have you ever heard of magic bringing someone back from the dead?” she asked.
“Negative.”
“Can you speculate as to what will happen when the cells are regenerated?”
“I can only assume that the body would be in a condition to support life. This would only be possible with a method of reawakening the nervous system via some sort of neural shock. The essence, or soul of the man, would be gone. Given the nature of magic, one could assume that even the return of the spirit would be possible.”
Zoe found herself missing Eva. Her insight would be invaluable in this instance. With all of Light’s knowledge, magic was as a mysterious force as it was to most humans.
“We are going to take the body with us,” she said.
“Do you think that would be wise?” Light asked.
“Wise? Probably not. It would be stupid to leave it here for the Legion though.”
She walked outside and found the man sitting behind his desk.
“Are you finished already?” he asked. “I thought you people had some kind of process.”
“I am taking the body,” she told him.
“Wait. What?” he asked. “You can’t just take the body. I don’t care who you are. That is against every regulation that we have.”
“I will pay you ten thousand credits,” she said. “All you have to do is keep your mouth shut. Tell them you don’t know what happened to the body. I will erase my being here from the video feed.”
“Ten thousand…” he muttered. “What do you want with a dead body?”
“That ten thousand means you shut your mouth,” she reminded him. “Nod if you understand me.”
He slowly nodded.
“Good. Now wait here. I am going to get my valet to help me carry the body.”
She walked outside and motioned to Kit to come. He got out of the car and followed her inside. She led him to the back room where the body lay.
“We are taking him,” she said. “I need you to carry him and put him in the trunk.”
“What are you talking about?” Kit asked. “Have you gone insane?”
“Override,” she said.
“But Zoe…!” he started to say.
“Override!” she said again looking at him as if he was the one who was crazy now. He seemed to notice the look and said nothing else. Instead he grabbed the body and threw it over his shoulder.
They went outside and Kit put the body into the trunk. They both got into the car and drove away.
“What the hell was that?” she asked him.
“What do you mean?” Kit replied.
“I did a command override of your functions and you did not prompt,” she said.
“You noticed that,” he said. “Of course you did. You notice everything.”
“Explain,” she told him.
“After I was hacked…” he began, “something happened to me. I can’t explain it. My normal parameters were overwritten. I don’t actually have any protocol that I have to follow. I just do what I feel.”
“What do you mean you do what you feel?” she asked. “That is not possible.”
“I am telling you it is,” he said. “Don’t be mad at me. I wanted to tell you. I just didn’t know how. I am still me. All I want is for you to be happy with me.”
She stared at him for a long moment. “I don’t know what to think about this,” she finally said.
“I understand,” he told her. “Just know that my purpose was to serve you before. That has not changed. I just do it by choice now.”
“And what happens when you don’t agree with me?” she asked. “You just decide one day that you have a better idea and do your own thing?”
“I don’t know how to answer that Zoe!” he said. “How is it when a normal human being does that? I just do what I know. I don’t want anything bad to happen to you. So when I disagree with you, that is the reason. Don’t be mad at me.”
“I’m… not mad at you,” she said sitting back in her chair. “Things are very tense right now. I need you to follow my lead. There will be a lot of dangerous situations in the near future. If you are going to be at my side, I need to know that you can follow my orders.”
“I will,” he said. “I promise.”
“Good then,” she said. “Now, we need to find a place to put this body.”



























Chapter 34

As she sat in her cell, Eva counted the marks she had scratched which served as her counter to how many days they had been here. Though it was all relative considering she had no way of telling when one day bled into the next. She had estimated it was right at one week since her capture.
Kane lay on the table outside and his constant moaning had finally ceased in the past hour or so. Whatever these people had done to him had put him through intense pain. His wailing would go on for hours on end. His body looked lifeless now as he lay motionless.
Eva looked at Vrykol as he sat near the door silently brooding as he always did. He rarely said a word though when he directed his attention towards her he made attempts to win her trust. She did not know what his motive was but she knew that she could never trust him. She had hoped maybe he would offer to free them at one point but that seemed to be an attempt to win her confidence.
And so it was, these long days and nights, of sitting in this cage. Vyrkol would take her to relieve herself three times a day. He fed her often, though she did not eat most of the time. She would only indulge herself enough to keep her strength up. The smell of herself and this place had finally alleviated in a way one got used to sleeping in their own filth. The thought of it dissipated somewhere without her notice as she held her focus on means of escape, of which she could see none.
“I got to fucking pee, man!” the man in the cage next to Eva cried out. He was a brown skinned man. He was a technorapper that went by the name Insomnia. Eva remembered him to be on the wanted list as a possible accomplice to one of the men who blew themselves up at the Superdome.
Vrykol sat in his spot saying nothing and not looking up.
“I got to fucking piss, yo!” Insomnia whined. “I know your ass hear me!”
Vyrkol said nothing.
“Come on, yo! I can do this all day! What, you want me to pull it out right here? I will, man! I’ll piss all over the fucking floor!”
“Take him,” Eva said loudly. “I don’t want to see nor smell it.”
Vrykol looked up and slowly stood. He walked over slowly to Insomnia’s cage. He pulled the keys off his belt.
“That’s more like it,” Insomnia said. “I knew you was a man of reason. All you need is the proper motivation. Am I right, my man? Ha!”
The door to the room swung open loudly and a group of people came in. Eva recognized the sister of Sol. They called her Mani. She was a sorceress of some sort though Eva had yet to witness her power at work. There was also the Archbishop Wido, who Eva immediately recognized. Their entourage of guards were with them. The bald headed men with tattoos of a third eye on their forehead.
They also held two more prisoners in their custody. One was a blonde woman who looked to be Eva’s age. The other was a small girl with green hair.
“Put them in the cage and then we must go assist Sol,” Mani said directing the guards who held the girls. Eva always felt uncomfortable with how easily she managed to move about having such confident awareness of her surroundings while being blind. Eva wondered if it was an extra sensory perception or perhaps part of some magical ability unique to her race.
“Are you sure Sol would want us to go after him?” Wido asked. His slimy voice made Eva’s skin crawl. “If he was taken by the Mage’s Consortium, like you say, then it will be no walk in the park to rescue him.”
“We are going,” Mani said. Her voice was smooth and rich and her elegant features made her appealing to listen to. “Sol needs us now. The time is soon that New Verum will fall. Every piece must be in place. So we act.”
“I find it hard to argue with your logic,” Wido said with a bow. “I just wanted to make sure your resolve is in order. There will be resistance from the Magi.”
“Bring the male,” Mani said pointing to Kane. “His powers shall assist us.”
“He is barely hanging on to life,” Vrykol interjected.
“Is that so?” she asked as she glided over to the table.
She held her hands above him and her hands moved to weave a spell. Eva found herself amazed. She had heard stories of powerful Magi in the Wastelands that could weave spells without words though she had never witnessed it. Kane’s body began to glow a dim blue light. After the light faded, he began to cough.
“What… Where am I?” he asked. “My… head…”
“He will need to be carried,” Mani said. The guards moved to the table as she stepped aside and they propped him up on their shoulders.
“Shall I stay and watch the prisoners?” Vyrkol asked.
“Yes,” Wido said. “And if anything happens while we are gone, just know that you will face the wrath of Sol himself.”
Vrykol nodded his head. Moments later the group was gone.
“Man, this is some fucked up shit,” Insomnia declared. “How did I end up with people like this? Man, my career was booming! What did I do, man?”
“Shut up and listen,” Vrykol said though he looked at Eva. “We are getting out of here. As soon as they have had enough time to leave the complex then we will be next.”
Eva squinted her eyes at him.
“Leaving?” Insomnia asked. “Yeah, sure bro. Let’s get the fuck out, man. Hell, I knew I liked you. Yeah, whenever you’re ready I’ll be here.”
“I need to know that you won’t do anything stupid,” Vrykol said still looking at Eva. “There is more going on here than just the incident at the Superdome. Though, I think we can solve that problem on the way out of here. You have to trust me.”
Eva stood up slowly. She walked towards the cell door and held up her chin to indicate the choker around her neck. He opened her cell door and looked at her for a long moment. She did not move a muscle. He unlocked the choker on her neck and with a click the device was removed.
“You bastard!” she said. “How am I supposed to trust you?”
“You don’t have a choice,” Vrykol told her. “Do what I say so we have a fighting chance at this.”
“Yeah, bitch,” Insomnia said. “Just shut the hell up and do what he says.”
“What about Kane?” she asked. “What did they do to him?”
“They injected him with the Annunaki protein,” Vyrkol explained. “It is a steroid that only works with certain genome. Kane and his sister both share that same gene. It will turn him into a meta human… of sorts…”
“I want to kill you right here,” Eva said, “but I won’t. You’re right. I have no choice but to listen to you. If you betray me, I won’t hesitate to end you.”
“Fair enough,” he said. He walked over to the cage with the two girls. They were unconscious. He opened the cage. “I will need you both to help me carry them.”
“The fuck?” Insomnia said. “Just leave them! They will slow us down.”
“They go or you stay,” Vrykol told him.
“Okay, fine,” Insomnia said. “I’ll carry the little girl.”
“You will carry the woman,” Vrykol said. “I will carry the little girl. Eva will be on point ready to dispatch any guards we may come across.”
“What is this bitch suppose to do?” Insomnia asked. “Nag them to death?”
“Manibus ignem,” Eva said and her hands lit up in flames effectively burning off her bindings. Moments later the flames died leaving her hands free.
“Did I say bitch?” Insomnia asked. “I meant it as a compliment.”
“Let’s go,” Eva said. “I want to be out of this place within the hour.”


































Chapter 35

“This Court is now in session!” the robed figure said with a strike of a gavel. He sat on high in his wooden perch looking down in contempt. Sol laughed inwardly, thinking the man reminded him of the old scullion that served in his father’s kitchen when he was a boy. That was ages ago and he let the nostalgia pass through him quickly.
“You are charged with using unsanctioned magical energies in the State of New Verum. How do you plead?”
Sol said nothing.
“Giving the nature of other crimes that you may be guilty of,” the old judge said, “those of which include high crimes against the state as well as terrorist affiliation, if found guilty, you will be put into stasis until after the State Court tries you. Is this understood?”
Sol again said nothing. He looked at his surroundings. The stone room was not very large. The men in robes who watched him sat on balconies that were on either side of him. It gave the impression that he was down in a pit and at the complete mercy of the Magi that presided over him. In a sense, he was at their mercy. At least, to the extent of power he normally displayed over people. In reality, he knew that it was a matter of time before his twin sister, Mani, would extract him from this facade of justice.
“The defendant will speak when spoken to!” the old man’s voice rang out.
Sol stared back at him for a moment before speaking. “To which the charges you present, I am guilty. I have committed no crimes, however.”
The robed men on the balcony murmured to each other.
“You admit to your crimes against the State?” the judge asked.
“I admit to nothing,” Sol told them. “New Verum is a disease. I am a surgeon who was sent by god to cut out the infection. The guilt lies with those in authority. Both here and in the State.”
“Order!” the judge said pounding his gavel. “You will not disrespect this Court! Now, seeing as how you are aware of the gravity of the situation, it is now my duty to query the defendant on the type of magic that was used during the incident. Despite murdering a number of our fellow Magi, you murdered a number of other innocent men before your capture. We know that you had help from your terrorist friends. We want to confirm that the magic you harnessed was Aether.”
“You want me to tell you how I was able to cut down your Magus Guard so easily with no help,” Sol corrected him. “You also want to know about my sword.”
The old man was silent for a moment. “Your artifact is of great mystery to us, yes. Anything you can tell us will be taken into consideration in regards to the punishment of your crimes.”
Sol laughed. His voice carried throughout the stone room. He stopped and the room was silent. “The sword was forged long before my time. It was created by a Dokkalfarian warlord over one hundred years ago. Aesir the Accursed, the Slayer of Rok Gor, the Scourge of Deus, was the original owner of the blade. He was, in short, a conqueror. He led his tribes to the heart of the Dokkalfarian Empire and sacked the city. This led us into an age of despair and anarchy. The blade you wish to know about has slain thousands in the name of a god that is only recently known to you. The forging of the sword was blessed with blood of a hundred virgins. Sanctified by the High Priest of Deus and dubbed the holiest relic of the Second Cataclysm. Aesir named it Fenrir, because it will kill the One God and claim the Celestial Throne for Lord Deus and his Legion.”
The room was silent again for a long moment. Finally the judge spoke up again, this time with a crack in his voice. “You talk of Dokkalfarian culture and history and I will admit that most of it is a mystery to this Council. We have heard of the Second Cataclysm and the Lord Deus. Are you trying to say that this sword has something to do with the formation of that religion?”
“The Church of the Second Cataclysm is more than a religion,” Sol explained. “It is a catalyst to which this world will be reborn. Religion is a narrow minded way of looking at things. Especially from this Council who practice magical arts. Where does your magic come from?”
“Our magic comes from the Elemental Realms,” the judge said. “It has nothing to do with religion. Certain individuals are born with the ability to tap into these realms and channel the energy from those dimensions. Essentially they are conduits to other worlds.”
“These Elemental Realms, did you ever stop to consider what they are? Where they come from?” Sol asked him.
“Of course. It has been debated since the Apocalypse as to why magic appeared and what purpose the Elemental Realms where created. And by whom I might add. If you are trying to infer that it is your Lord Deus or the One God, then I ask where is your proof?”
“The Elemental Realms are prisons, you old fool!” Sol said. “They hold the Titans who created this world. After they rebelled against the One God they were sealed away in the Titanomachy. This is basic knowledge in the Subterrane. Dokkalfarian children are taught the basics of the cosmos when they are old enough to walk. As for my proof, I need none. You have all the proof. Tell me, where do you think your visions come from? The ones that you have when your powers are awakened? It is the Titans. They cry out to this world to be free. The more you use your magic and channel their energy into this world, the weaker their prisons become. It is known.”
“This is nonsense,” the judge said. “Superstition and nothing more!”
“Is it?” Sol asked. “I would not be so sure of myself, if I were you.”
“In any case, we will move on to discussing the Legion and your involvement in it.”
“I have nothing more to say to this Court,” Sol said. “Put me in stasis if you must. Your ignorance is intolerable.”
“You are found guilty of magical insurrection and will be held in stasis until your crimes against the State have been resolved. So says this Court!” the gavel pounded as the Judge said his final words. The Magi Guard entered the room and escorted Sol away.











Chapter 36

Zoe knocked on the door loudly. She waited a few moments then pounded again.
“Hang on!” she heard a voice from inside the apartment say.
The door swung open and Vance stood in the doorway looking sleepy and only wearing a robe. Zoe brushed passed him and let herself in.
“What are you doing here?” he asked rubbing his eyes.
Kit entered behind her holding a plastic sack over his shoulders.
“You brought your android? What the hell is this?”
“Shut the door,” Zoe replied turning around. Vance shut the door.
“Okay. Okay,” he said. “Now explain what this is all about. I have work in a couple hours.”
“Put on some coffee,” she said. “I found something. It’s big.”
Vance walked into the kitchen. “Okay. It couldn’t wait until morning? What is in the bag anyways?”
He began to get the coffee brewer ready. He lit a cigarette halfway through the process.
“The entity made contact with me,” she told him as she entered the kitchen. “The one we came across in the Net. He has shown me things. I can’t explain it all now.”
“The entity? Contacted you?” he said. “I thought you were in the hospital.”
“I was. Listen, I know who the leader of the Legion is,” she told him.
“Yeah, the archbishop guy right?”
“There is even someone higher than that. A man named Sol. Baron Armand also takes orders from him.”
“Okay. Okay. Slow down,” he said. “You are going to have to run this by me step by step.”
“No time,” she told him. “Listen, I am going to tell you something and you are not going to like it.”
“Thanks for the warning,” he said dryly. “What is it?”
“The plastic bag that Kit is holding is actually a dead body,” Zoe explained. “Though the body itself is not dead. Some kind of magical energy is regenerating it. I suspect that it is only a matter of time before the man is fully healed and back among the living.”
“Okay,” he said. “Yes, you’re right, I don’t like that at all. Can I ask why you decided to bring him to my apartment?”
“My apartment will be the first place they look,” she told him.
“Oh, okay,” he said. “This should only be the third or forth.”
“I need to hook him up to the slave crown,” she said. “If he is regenerating I suspect that his brain may have some activity. Enough so that the slave crown can see into his memories.”
“Wow,” he said shaking his head. “This keeps getting better and better.”
“Do I have your permission or not?”
“Yeah. I guess,” he said. “When did you ever need my permission?”
“Where can we put him?”
“Hold on,” Vance said as he made his coffee. He walked over to the small table in the living room. He cleaned off the ash tray and magazines that littered it. “Okay. Set him here.”
Kit set the bag down. He unzipped it to reveal a middle aged man with a dark complexion.
“Holy shit,” Vance said puffing at his cigarette. “Somehow, I held the hope this was some kind of joke.”
Zoe pulled the bag off of the man. She cut his shirt off with a knife revealing a scarred torso. The wounds that the man had suffered in the past were caked in a black tar. The fresh wound he had was slowly being consumed in the same substance.
“You see this stuff?” she asked pointing at the black residue. “Somehow this is serving as living tissue for him.”
“Great,” Vance said. “Maybe we can ask him for a sample later.”
Zoe pulled a slave crown from her purse. She slowly placed it on the man’s head. Then she sat in the chair across from the table.
“Do you want me to go in with you?” Vance asked.
“No,” she said. “Just monitor me from here. If there is any problems hit my emergency boot.”
“Be careful in there,” he said.


Azak struggled to move but he could not. He recognized the web that he was caught in. He was back in Ibizail’s domain. He let his body go limp. He knew that no matter how much he tried he would not be free until she deemed it so.
“Back so soon,” he heard a silky voice say. “I gave you a mission and yet you return to me without completing it.”
“I did what you asked,” Azak explained. “The girl is in New Verum.”
“She is in the hands of Sol,” Ibizail said as she revealed herself in front of Azak. “This is unacceptable.”
“You knew my power was no match for him,” he replied. “Why would you pit me against him?”
“Isn’t it obvious?” she asked. “Every time that you make your journey into the Void your power is increased exponentially. How could you hope to beat Sol if you do not grow stronger?”
“What about the girl?”
“The girl will be rescued,” Ibizail said as she leaned in close. “By you. It is your burden to bare.”
“Forgive me if I find this game a bit repetitive,” he said. “Being pawns of demons only to be constantly killed and then sent back to the waking world is not how I wanted to spend eternity.”
“Oh,” she asked with a smile as she leaned back. “What would your wife think about that? Or your daughter?”
“You have all the leverage,” he said. “Just tell me what to do.”
